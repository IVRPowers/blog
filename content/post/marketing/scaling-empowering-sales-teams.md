# Harnessing the Power of Transactional Video Calls in Business Processes.
---

In an era increasingly defined by digitalization, businesses are compelled to reimagine their sales strategies to maintain relevance and competitiveness. While traditional face-to-face interactions have long been a cornerstone of sales, harnessing the potential of video calls can profoundly impact the scalability and efficacy of your employee sales force. Transitioning from conventional on-site engagements to transaccional video calls (direct real-time transfer) presents a disruptive opportunity for transformative growth in sales. Here's how this shift can revolutionize your sales approach:

## Operational Levels for Sales Force Optimization: Examples

![Operational Levels for Sales Team Force Optimization: Examples](/postimages/marketing/scaling-sales-force.003.jpeg)

### ◼︎ Level 1: Traditional Sales Model (Onsite)

This model mirrors the conventional setup found in many businesses, where each branch hosts an on-site sales team catering to local customers. This approach entails sizing each branch to optimize face-to-face interactions, typically maintaining a 1:1 ratio. At this level 1, it is impossible to take advantage of the sales force at off-peak times for other centers; it would mean displacing it. Obviously, it is not easy to increase capacity if the site is more crowded.

### ◼︎ Level 2: Hybrid Sales Model (Onsite / Remote)

Introducing a hybrid model involves incorporating service kiosks alongside local on-site teams at each branch. This strategy facilitates a more balanced service distribution, reducing the necessity for maximum capacity at each branch while increasing effectiveness to a 1:1.5 ratio. At this level 2, we can take better advantage of low occupancy moments that can occur at different times and thus not lose productivity. At the same time we can reduce operating costs since we do not need to mobilize the sales force in each center but can adjust the capacity by attending remotely.

### ◼︎ Level 3: Extended Sales Model (Onsite / Remote / Online)

Expanding on the hybrid model, this approach allows for the utilization of hybrid agents who can operate both face-to-face and remotely as needed throughout the day. Additionally, this model accommodates customer interactions accessed through web platforms, further broadening sales opportunities to a ratio of 1:1.7. At this level 3, we optimize not only by better serving each center, but we can also introduce remote support for potential customers who have gone to a geographic center. We can also balance face-to-face and virtual support for each location as well as for requests coming from the Internet.

These operational models provide a roadmap for transforming from an exclusively face-to-face model (Level 1) to progressively more efficient setups (Levels 2 and 3). While particularly pertinent to service models like car dealerships, the principles apply across various sectors seeking to enhance sales team productivity while minimizing downtime and costs to engage more potential customers.

## 7 Benefits of Digital Transformation: Sales Team Force

### 1. Breaking Geographic Barriers
Digital video calls liberate sales teams from geographic constraints, enabling representatives to connect with potential customers globally, thereby expanding market reach significantly.

### 2. Cost-Efficiency and Resource Optimization
Adopting digital video calls reduces overhead costs associated with physical locations and extensive travel, allowing for the reallocation of resources towards digital infrastructure and training, leading to streamlined operations and increased efficiency.

### 3. Enhanced Flexibility and Accessibility
Digital video calls offer unprecedented flexibility for both sales representatives and customers, allowing meetings to be conducted from any location with internet access, thus accommodating dynamic business demands without sacrificing productivity.

### 4. Personalization at Scale
While face-to-face interactions foster personal connections, digital video calls enable personalized engagement on a larger scale through features like virtual product demonstrations, enhancing customer interactions and improving conversion rates.

### 5. Data-Driven Decision Making
Digital sales channels provide valuable insights into customer behavior and sales performance, enabling businesses to optimize strategies and adapt to market trends through real-time data analysis.

### 6. Remote Training and Development
Transitioning to digital video calls facilitates remote training and development programs, ensuring consistent skill development across the sales team regardless of geographical location.

### 7. Agility in a Dynamic Landscape
Embracing digital video calls enables businesses to stay agile and responsive to technological advancements and shifting consumer preferences, ensuring competitiveness in a rapidly evolving marketplace.

In summary, the transition from traditional face-to-face sales to digital video calls represents a pivotal shift in sales strategy. By embracing digitalization, businesses can transcend geographical limitations, optimize resources, enhance flexibility, personalize interactions, leverage data insights, facilitate remote training, and maintain agility in an ever-changing landscape. Embracing this transformation presents not only a necessity but also an opportunity to revolutionize sales approaches and drive sustainable growth in the digital age.

It should be noted that these models cannot be solved with videoconference systems or virtual meetings, since the only way to be really effective is to use direct service technology with automatic distribution with immediate transfer to the available representative without waiting. In no case has it been efficient to propose appointment scheduling systems or make customers wait for a digital access, it is understood that if there is a digital device, it must respond instantly, saving time to the user and facilitating a faster interaction.
