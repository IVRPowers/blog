# Elevating Consumer Online Confidence through Video Real-Time Communications.
---

Users abandon online transactions not only due to poor UX but also because they need trust in the process. Users want to feel secure when conducting online transactions, especially when it involves sharing personal or financial information. **An intuitive and user-friendly interface is crucial for a good user experience, but trust in the process also plays a vital role**. Users should feel comfortable and safe at every stage of the transaction process, from navigating the website to completing the payment. Therefore, companies looking to reduce online transaction abandonment should focus not only on improving the user experience but also on building and maintaining user trust throughout the transaction process.

> Over 70% of online transactions fail due to both UX issues and lack of user confidence.

If a user lacks sufficient trust in a brand or is hesitant to make a transaction on your website to purchase one of your products or services, offering the option to communicate directly and in real time with a human being via voice and video can more effectively solve that problem. The ability to **interact directly with another individual, seeing their face and hearing their voice brings a better level of authenticity, security, support and comfort** that is often missing from purely digital channels like website, live chat , WhatsApp or even phone services where we cannot visually identify the person who is serving us.
