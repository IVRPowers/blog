# Beyond automation: The best customer experience, lies in an authentic and human interaction.
---

While Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools can provide speed, efficiency and convenience, they lack sufficient empathy, a full emotional understanding of the customer to take nuanced decisions that humans possess. Face-to-Face conversations bring a personal touch, better connection and adaptability that are essential for fostering trust and building customer effective transactions for businesses. In complex or sensitive situations, **human judgment and intuition are invaluable, ensuring customer understanding prevail**. Considering that many companies abuse digital channels that can be ineffective, frustrating or poorly addressed, most users prefer a brand that is able to serve them directly without barriers and with authenticity.

> Let's embrace technology while cherishing the irreplaceable value of human communication in customer experience.
