#	What if in COVID-19's times, we could sell more?

Join us at next **25th November, 16:00 CET** at next Salesland 20 years event!

With:

* **Javier Arellano**, Sales Manager and Businesss Development at Salesland Group.
* **Ivan Sixto**, Founder and CEO at Interactive Powers.

The pandemic crisis caused by Covid-19 has created an acceleration in the digitalization processes of our society, but what about people? Why do we have to do without your sales team when you can reinvent their stall by making use of technology? 

Brands need to keep bringing their products and services closer to their customers despite the situation we are going through. In this Webinar, we will talk and discuss the human factor in sales and the possibilities of natural integration of the salesperson in the digital world.
