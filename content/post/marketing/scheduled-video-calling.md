First of all, you have to properly send a invite to each user/customer to join a one-to-one videocall from any modern device. This invite has to be one-click to ensure the connection is user-friendly but the same time, it is useful to enable other professional to connect this video session in case of any delay in the schedule.

> Scheduled Video Calls are a new trend for business video communications.

##	No Downloads, No Register, No Apps

In a second part, users or customers have to join a videocall from any modern device without any downnload, any registration or app / plugins otherwise the process won't be efficient and accepted by most existing users.

> Video interactions cannot be depend on specific mobile apps, plugins or devices.
