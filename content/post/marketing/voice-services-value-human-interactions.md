#	Digital Transformation in Contact Center is not about Voice over IP, it's about IA automation and more advanced human-to-human online collaboration.

If the leading brands Google, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft are going to stay ahead of the competition, they need to quickly learn how to engage with customers using voice command technology in a meaningful way. **All automated customer service platforms work using the same basic principle: process a question, crunch the relevant data, and deliver a response**. The big leap forward will come when advances in AI accelerate the range of questions they can process, and make the responses they can deliver more personalised and, ultimately, more conversational and human.

##	Focusing in higher human and emotional communication.

All this means that all the customer service has to re-evaluate how it resources itself. Currently, **around 70 per cent of all activities in a Call Center could be fully automated by AI in the next decade**. This means that most agents will work alongside AI-powered systems to handle the complex, judgement-based tasks a robot can’t. One of this growing demand is the human touch and video face-to-face [RTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/real-time-communications-applications/) communications, that couldn’t yet be driven by machines.

##	All tasks have to be redesigned with new skills and systems.

So, as businesses prepare for the rise of voice-command tech, Contact Centers  should reinvent their channels approach and are also be tailoring their recruitment and training strategies to attract the right profile of people. This way, they’ll have a workforce ready to take their services into the future.
