# Make video calls from WhatsApp conversations

Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you needed to seamlessly transition from a WhatsApp text conversation between a user and an agent to a direct call or video call? Unfortunately, WhatsApp's default functionality does not provide direct call trunking capabilities to enable Voice over IP (VOIP) calls within a conversation. This limitation significantly hampers the potential for enhancing user support experiences. However, there's good news on the horizon! SPLIT WhatsApp is introducing an innovative solution to bridge this gap.

SPLIT WhatsApp is set to revolutionize the way Contact Center agents interact with users by offering a direct call link connection. This groundbreaking feature will enable a smooth transition from text-based conversations to voice or video calls, opening up new possibilities for more effective and personalized customer support. By integrating this functionality, businesses can elevate their WhatsApp-based customer service to new heights, providing a more comprehensive, intuitive and responsive support experience for their users.
