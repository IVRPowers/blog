A **WebRTC System** can bring several benefits to all types of enterprises and users. For different market segments, the benefit would really be overwhelming, as the app would give them the power to open up a wealth of opportunities to serve their clients and customers, in a very innovative way. Using the network, companies can open up real-time and live video chats sessions with customers, and vice-versa, to provide their help and support. Here are some of the benefits that Web Real Time Communications can provide to all businesses and its users:

## Multiple Devices Support.
Since there are 3.5 billion internet users worldwide, you can always assume that WebRTC will automatically tap this huge market. However, since the internet is divided into different browsers and different platforms, you might say the app has to be ubiquitous to work as per expectations. Sellers and marketers, in turn, can use this technology to chat and interact, with visual and audio aids, with a click of a mouse button. 

## Communications Security.
WebRTC is secure as their data encryption involved in this browser-to-browser communication tool. Your Chrome or Firefox would also request the users to verify whether it wants to allow a website to have access to its video/audio data. Buyers, hence, do not have to worry about security and market places can connect with them without any hindrance.

## Real-Time Connection.
WebRTC provides a direct and a real-time connection from one user to another. With it, companies/executives can directly video chat with customers/clients on a real-time basis right from the browser page itselfâ€”that is, in one single click. Even the customers would save money thanks to the ingenious method.

## Direct Connection or Peer-to-Peer.
What companies want the most is to have a direct line to the customers. In return, even the customers want a hotline with companies for customer support and help. This is one of the key elements of any customer support. The WebRTC provides that habite browser direct connection.
