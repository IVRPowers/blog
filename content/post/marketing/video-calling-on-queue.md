[Video RTC  for Genesys](https://appfoundry.genesys.com/filter/purecloud/listing/92e43173-b662-4bb6-9068-f897ac8590ac) a unique complementary solutions for Contact Center that allow to **handle Video Calling  “On Queue” for your Contact Center** thanks to [SPLIT Forward](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-split-forward/) / [SPLIT Reverse](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-split-reverse/) a convergent WebRTC / SIP communications integration. Most existing Video powered addons are only working “Off Queue” because these products do not control any ACD event during all digital interactions and obviously cannot manage both inbound / outbound phone calls and video calls.

If you require to keep running all your Contact Center **agents with a maximum effectivity and productivity levels**, it’s really important to connect  your videocalls and web collaboration  tasks “On Queue”.
