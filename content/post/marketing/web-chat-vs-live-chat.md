# What are the difference about these two chat modalities, and considerations to have during a text typed business communication?
---

Most existing Contact Centers have added a Chat Channel to connect their agents with online connected users without the help of a phone. Today, Itâ€™s really important to understand properly what is the best way to use any Chat modality in order to avoid an integration nightmare in the future or less integration reworks for your business processes.

##	What is a Multi-session Web Chat?

This option is well known in most Contact Center software because it allows an agent to take several chat conversations at the same time (multi-session). Some of these platforms are not allowing their agents to manage more than one stream at the same time and only work in a single session chat conversation.

##	What is a Real-Time Communication Live Chat?

This element is part of most used features inside real-time communications platforms to provide a typed text support during any voice or video conversation. This modality is pure RTC secure data-channel feature and is not properly recorded without an external database storage.
