# Make a Voice or Video Call from WhatsApp conversations

WhatsApp business conversations with contact centers or bots face significant limitations. They primarily rely on text-based communication, lacking real-time, voice-to-voice interaction. These constraints often result in misunderstandings, slower problem resolution, and a less personal customer experience (CX). Without immediate vocal communication, the natural flow of conversation is impeded, making it challenging to convey tone, urgency, or complex information effectively.

Now, you can expand your reach and connect with customers on WhatsApp in groundbreaking ways. WhatsApp Business enables you to create highly personalized and scalable customer engagement tailored to your unique live chat needs. By combining Video RTC's advanced real-time communications with access to first-party customer data, you'll have all the tools necessary to enhance customer relationships, streamline communications, and drive business growth.
