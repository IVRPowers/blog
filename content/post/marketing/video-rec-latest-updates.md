# Enhanced Security,  Monitoring and Users Logs
---

We're excited to announce a series of significant updates for our [Video REC](https://interactivepowers.com/en/platforms/videorec) platform this quarter. These enhancements are designed to improve user experience, strengthen security, and expand system monitoring capabilities. The result is a more robust and user-friendly environment for all our valued users.

### Users Logs Generation and Exportation

First and foremost, [Video REC](https://interactivepowers.com/en/platforms/videorec) now boasts an advanced and comprehensive user log system. This sophisticated and powerful tool allows for detailed and extensive monitoring of all transactions within the system. By providing administrators with in-depth and granular insights into user activities and system operations, this feature enables more effective management and oversight of the platform. This enhanced visibility not only improves security but also aids in identifying patterns, optimizing workflows, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.

### Authentication Security Increased

In a major leap forward for security, [Video REC](https://interactivepowers.com/en/platforms/videorec) has implemented mandatory **two-factor authentication (2FA)** with **One-Time Password (OTP)** functionality. This additional layer of robust security ensures that user accounts are fortified against unauthorized access, even in scenarios where passwords might be compromised. By requiring a second form of verification, we significantly reduce the risk of account breaches, protecting sensitive information and maintaining the integrity of our users' data. This implementation underscores our commitment to providing a secure environment for all [Video REC](https://interactivepowers.com/en/platforms/videorec) users in all regions.

### System Monitoring Improvements

Lastly, we have introduced expanded and enhanced monitoring capabilities to [Video REC](https://interactivepowers.com/en/platforms/videorec). This feature provides a more comprehensive and nuanced view of system nodes performance and interactions. By offering deeper insights into various aspects of the platform's operation, we enable better troubleshooting, more efficient problem resolution, and continuous optimization of the [Video REC](https://interactivepowers.com/en/platforms/videorec) platform. This proactive approach to system management allows us to identify and address potential issues before they impact user experience, ensuring smoother operation and higher satisfaction levels among our customer base.
