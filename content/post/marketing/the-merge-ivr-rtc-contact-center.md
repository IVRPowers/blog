# Contact Center: Artificial Inteligence and Omnichannel strategies will require to upgrade and rethink all your IVR and RTC technology or services.
---

When we launched our first interactive solutions, we always have considered the Contact Center as a primary technology platform that requires to connect many and new channels to become a **Multi-channel** system  or much better ever an **Omnichannel** system. In the early **Digital Age Transformation**, we couldn’t imagine our two main business product lines [IVR](https://www.ivrpowers.com/voicexml/) and [RTC](https://www.ivrpowers.com/video-rtc/) to become so close that they are now just part of a whole strategic approach into a up-to-date Contact Center. Let us show, how it is so powerful to consider… without leaving existing channels or services witch are already running. We always understand integration as a complementary function and value not a replacement.

## RTC · Real-Time Communications

This technology provides a secure access to all new modern devices thanks to an RTC channel for any Contact Center and extending all its communications capacity to Web Browsers, Kiosks, Smartphones or Tablets devices. Could you really manage any online marketing,  sales or support without considering real-time interactions for your business processes. Today customers and users won't be justing calling you, they are considering you can interact through any device or your online services.

> Phone is not yet the only direct channel, you have to connect more devices and services.

What kind of features are we expecting to use with RTC:

* Voice / Video streaming
* Live Chat
* File Sharing
* Screen Sharing / CoBrowsing

## IVR · Interactive Voice Response

This technology is not really new for a Contact Center but it is now a new breakthrough that is transforming the customers services thanks to IA and Voicebots / Speech Assistants integration. IVR is not what we use to understand as DTMF menus or simple Direct Dialog call routing… Today, IVR is becoming a smart conversational system able to replace human agents in most of repetitive or require  Call Steering with an Natural Language Processing / Understanding.

> Agents are no longer the only way to interact properly and efficiently with your customers.

What kind of features arre we expecting to use with IVR:

* DTMF
* Text-to-Speech
* Speech Recognition
* Natural Language Processing / Understanding
