##	Our Vision for your Business Communications.

**Interactive Powers vision is to streamline your business communications** with the help of our two core technologies called [IVR](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-ivr/) (Interactive Voice Response) and [RTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-ivr/) (Real-Time Communications). Our platforms embrace open standards like **SIP** (Session Initialization Protocol), [VoiceXML](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-voicexml/) (Voice eXtended Meta Language), [RTMP](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-voicexml/) (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) and [WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/) (Web Real-Time Communications) allowing businesses to directly embed audio-only or audio & video conversations and collaboration functionality within their website or mobile customer care apps. Contextual information around the customer’s journey can be shared with any PBX or third-party call center environment for seamless handover from a **conversational self-service to face-to-face agent video assistance**.

##	Voice and Video Interactions running seamless together.

Our IVR and RTC solutions enhances mobile apps and websites with access to a channel for real-time communication. **Customers benefit from audio, video, live chat, dual-file sharing, dual-screen sharing, snapshot and much more...** without having to download additional plugins. The underlying technology leverages the latest high-definition audio and enables seamless transition from one interaction channel to another without repeating information.

##	Easy integration for your PBX and existing Call Center.

Contacts can be pre-qualified by conversational IVR before being routed to the appropriate user or agent, reducing average handling time and improving first contact resolution. The customer/agent interactions enabled by the [VoiceXML IVR](http://www.ivrpowers.com/voicexml) and [Video RTC](http://www.ivrpowers.com/videortc) platforms improve customer satisfaction by giving customers direct access to callcenter agents at the point and place where it’s needed personalized experience with video. Agents, too, have an **improved experience via face-to-face contact with video and high-definition audio** and the ability to better interact online with documents or web collaboration.

##	Software is not just a question of Technology.

Additionally, run both a [Cloud Hosting](http://www.ivrpowers.com/cloud-hosting) with [CPaaS](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-cpaas/) or [SaaS](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-saas/) can control costs by reducing PSTN (public switched telephone network) costs by processing incoming calls using Internet telephony and the SIP protocol, and is available with a **Pay-as-you-go friendly subscription** pricing model based on per-port (cloud) or per-port (on-premises) usage.
