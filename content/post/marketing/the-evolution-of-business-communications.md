#	Leading companies have a wholeness approach about how to communicate better with their customers across their processes.
-------
Communicate is a top priority for businesses today — but how can you quantify its value to your organization?  That’s especially important in these times, with businesses managing the economic impact and uncertainty of disruptive events, and how this will impact both their customers and employees going forward. The History of Business Communications is, of course, closely linked with the histories of Communications itself and that of Business Operations. When the two merge, they become a vital part of successful Commerce. We have now entered the Digital Age of VoIP – the world is moving away from static landlines and computers, and into an era where you can carry out all of your Business Communication tasks from the palm of your hand.

###	Stage 1: At the beginning… Telephony is first.

Some companies start with a phone line or a small [PBX](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/customerengagement/how-to-improve-your-pbx-with-conversational-ai/) to receive or make phone calls. We consider this stage first stay-connected step of any company. Even if  in the Digital World, it's possible to start directly to the next stage, no company or self-entrepreneur can manage any business without a phone for its first employees. This Stage is the phone only communication, but remember that in the current situation, telephony can use SMS for texting and you can use specific apps that improve your telephony without to much cost and effort.

Required Systems: **PBX**

###	Stage 2: World Wide Web... Adding a Business Website.

At this moment, this stage can be considered the most important stage for any business. World Wide Web (WEB) is now a direct communication tool that is not possible to forget even if your business is not fully digital. At this stage most Small and Medium Businesses have reached their goals to be properly located in the World Wide Web and can get directly contacted by phone with few volume of calls. This stage ensure that you can talk with a customer or partner that require to contact in real-time but without to much options... Remember a PBX, is just to route calls it's not properly designed to manage any kind of processes for human interactions.

![Stage 2: Business Communications](/postimages/marketing/slide-2021-11.005.png)

Required Systems: **WEB + PBX**

###	Stage 3: Manage Socials and Video Meetings...

This stage is becoming a leading one  for the current Digital World, World Wide Web (WEB) is not only a question of web page but can have much more feature, like an online store, blog, chatbot, socials networks linking all these specific tools to better communicate with your Internet users. By the way, your employees requires to use conferences based in Peer-to-Peer ([P2P](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-peer-to-peer/)) communications to perform video meetings because work is now extended to different places or offices... At this stage, most companies are thinking, they have already solved most of their communications levels but wait for the next stage... It's not really true!

![Stage 3: Business Communications](/postimages/marketing/slide-2021-11.006.png)

Required Systems: **WEB + PBX + P2P**

###	Stage 4: When the Telephony is not enough powerful...

When a Business becomes greater and manages much more user interactions, the initial PBX becomes a bottle neck that can compromise your business processes and employees. Most companies do not feel the right moment they need to scale their communication with an [IVR](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-ivr/) or [ACD](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-acd/) to improve automation and phone calls performance. Both technologies are critical in a context of high volume of calls, workflows and process management. At this stage, most companies in the past century thought they have reached a complete multi-channel attention and nothing more could improve their business communications.

![Stage 4: Business Communications](/postimages/marketing/slide-2021-11.007.png)

Required Systems: **WEB + PBX + IVR / ACD + P2P**

###	Stage 5: Unified Real Time Communications required!

Current Digital World require real-time interactions where customers and partner cannot wait for sequential tasks like a call meeting, email or web form, they really need to feel much more that the company is Omnichannel. By the way, video is not yet a nice to have, your customers expect to meet your employees or agents in a face to face communication to get better convergence between real and virtual interactions. At this point, [RTC](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-rtc/) platforms or gateways are really a mandatory element to enclose all channels and transform digital channels to the next level!
