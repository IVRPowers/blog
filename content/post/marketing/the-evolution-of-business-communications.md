###	Stage 1: At the beginning… Telephony comes first.

Some companies start just with a phone line or a small [PBX](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/customerengagement/how-to-improve-your-pbx-with-conversational-ai/) to receive or make phone calls. **We consider this stage first stay-connected step of any company**. Even if  in the Digital Age, it's possible to start directly to the next stage, no company or self-entrepreneur can manage any business without a phone for its first employees. This Stage is the phone only communication, but remember that in the current situation, telephony can use SMS for texting and you can use specific apps that improve your telephony without to much cost and effort.

Required Systems: **PBX**

###	Stage 2: World Wide Web... Website is essential.

At this moment, this stage can be considered the most important stage for any business. **World Wide Web (WEB) is now a key communication tool that is not possible to forget** even if your business is not fully digital. At this level, most Small and Medium Businesses have reached their goals to be properly located in the World Wide Web and can get directly contacted by phone with few volume of calls. This stage ensures that you can talk with a customer or partner requiring to talk but without to much complexity... Remember a [PBX](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/customerengagement/how-to-improve-your-pbx-with-conversational-ai/) handles calls, but it's not properly designed to manage a large volume of traffic to any extension attended by a human.

![Stage 2: Business Communications](/postimages/marketing/slide-2021-11.005.png)

Required Systems: **WEB + PBX**

###	Stage 3: Socials and Video Meetings are required...

This stage is becoming a leading one  for the Digital Age, World Wide Web (WEB) is not only a question of website but can adding much more value web elements, like an online store, blog, chatbot, socials networks and linking all these specific tools to better communicate with all Internet users. By the way, **employees connect remotely much more than ever for their diary activities using video conferences** based on Peer-to-Peer ([P2P](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-peer-to-peer/)) communications to perform virtual meetings because work is now extended to different places or offices... At this stage, most companies are thinking, they have already solved most of their communications issues but wait for the next stage... It's not yet really true!

![Stage 3: Business Communications](/postimages/marketing/slide-2021-11.006.png)

Required Systems: **WEB + PBX + P2P**

###	Stage 4: Empowered Telephony is no longer optional...

When your business becomes greater and it manages more users interactions, your initial PBX is a bottle neck that could compromise your business processes and employees tasks. **Most companies do not feel properly the right moment to scale their communications** with an [IVR](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-ivr/) or [ACD](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-acd/) to improve calls automation and performance. Both platforms are a required in a context of high volume of calls, workflows and process management. At this stage, companies in the past years thought they had reached a complete multi-channel attention and nothing more could improve Business Communications.

![Stage 4: Business Communications](/postimages/marketing/slide-2021-11.007.png)

Required Systems: **WEB + PBX + IVR / ACD + P2P**

###	Stage 5: Video Real Time Communications are required!

**Digital evolution trend requires more valuable and real-time interactions** to avoid that customers and partners have to waste time with transactional tasks like a call meetings, emails or web forms, they really need to feel much more speed and Omnichannel experience. Right now, [video is no longer a nice to have, it's a must have](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/trends/video-is-no-longer-a-nice-to-have-it-is-a-must-have/). Your customers expect to meet your employees or agents in a face-to-face communication modality to get **a better convergence between presential and virtual interactions**. At this point, [RTC](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-rtc/) platforms or gateways are a mandatory component to enclose video communications and transform all digital channels!

Required Systems: **WEB + PBX + IVR / ACD + P2P + RTC**
