# Transactional Video Calls: Upgrading Contact Center Communications

**Transactional Video Calls** offer a suite of advanced communication features designed to boost performance and productivity in contact center environments. These calls provide a more efficient and targeted approach compared to traditional video meetings, rooms, or peer-to-peer conferencing methods. They enable streamlined interactions and improved customer service through routing, distribution, queuing, on-hold capabilities, and transfer functions. Additionally, they include collaboration features such as Live Chat, File Sharing, Screen Sharing, and CoBrowsing to enhance human conversation and remote assistance resolution.

Powered by our innovative SPLIT protocol, Transactional Video Calls seamlessly integrate with our proprietary Web ACD system and a wide range of third-party CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service) platforms and Contact Center Software solutions. This integration elevates video call functionality to new levels, enabling businesses to leverage cutting-edge video communication within their existing contact center infrastructure. By incorporating Transactional Video Calls, organizations can enhance their customer engagement strategies, improve agent productivity, and deliver a more personalized and effective video-based support experience.
