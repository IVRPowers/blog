# Most people think that the Digital Revolution in Telephony has already occurred when voice over IP communications has progressively replaced landline connections.
---

Currently, most telephony is digital and IP powered but that’s not the only thing that voice telecommunication requires in order to become more attractive and useful to users. You have to understand that **there’s no difference for users in making phone calls via Landline or in a SIP extension**, the user calling experience is remains the same. **The only thing that changes is the technology and the cost**. Currently, VoIP is becoming a commodity where the pricing and quality of service are the main factors that customers compare when looking for a new provider.

## Stay away from becoming a commodity service.

For a long time, [IVR](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-ivr/) has been a technology used to route and optimize the calls in call centers but not really suitable for users. Today, [the evolution of Speech API](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/trends/cloud-api-trend/) and [AI is changing everything](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/trends/ai-contact-center/) - it transforms [IVR](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-ivr/) into an advanced conversational Voice Assistant. This service is becoming a value added for any Voice over IP service. Even though you can say that selling the VoIP traffic is the core for each business but like for many industries, becoming a commodity can kill your benefits in no matter of time. To avoid the downgrade in your rates and support, add an additional value to your VoIP service to get a stronger and longer relationship with your customers.

##	To protect your VoIP business, always add more value.

Forget about the old-fashioned [IVR](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-ivr/) services, it’s no longer a menu driven service that you leave your customers solve by themselves. Think of providing all-in-one **value added voice services** - your customers will appreciate any additional service that's means not having to spend more time on research and integrations. Protect your VoIP business by providing better and smarter services as this is the key factor to keep more traffic and retain your clients.
