# Extending and empowering your business with Video Interactions out of the Contact Center.

The adoption of video communications continues to expand globally. As more businesses are using video to connect with their users or customers remotely and realizing the importance of improving their customer experience, it is more critical than ever for video interactions to be as simple as possible. This is why more and more teams today are choosing our solutions so that callers do not need to download or install any application to connect instantaneously.
