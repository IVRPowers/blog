One of the leading sectors among advanced solutions is [Real-Time Communications technology.]( http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/trends/increasing-business-rtc/) Communication through voice, video or messaging in real time is opening up endless applications for many businesses, including telemedicine. Until now, telehealth has focused on hospitals and adults, but **new opportunities start being considered.**


## Don't skip classes anymore.

When children need to see a doctor, not only do they miss school, but parents have to leave work for appointment. Telemedicine offers the possibility of **reducing miss days for children and parents.** New technologies in real time allow that if children suffer from mild illnesses, they can connect with medical services at convenience from school.

The provision of the necessary medical and technological equipment to schools would make it possible for children to visit the doctor through videoconference, without losing any class, **when they need it and from a family environment.** Parents can join the session, connecting remotely from a video-enable device, such as a smartphone or a laptop, without leaving their work. In addition, telemedicine for pediatric care helps improve prevention and manage chronic conditions in children.
