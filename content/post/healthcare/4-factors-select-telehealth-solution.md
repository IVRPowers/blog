Implementing telehealth can help physicians reach people in remote or rural areas who may not be able to travel to a particular facility or specialist as well as those in more densely populated urban areas who find inner-city mass transit insufficient for their needs. As a result, more organizations are turning to telehealth as a viable alternative to routine in-office physician visits.

To implement properly the kind of telehealth solution that both clinicians and patients will trust and use takes a lot of up-front planning, you should consider these four key considerations before putting telehealth into practice:

## Patient User Experience.
The success or failure of a telehealth solution is solely determined by patients’ willingness to use it. How closely the experience mimics previous in-person visits will depend largely on the quality of the service, an area where a medical-grade network ready for anywhere-anytime-any device communication plays an important role.

## Physician Workflow.
Doctors, nurses and other clinicians are very busy people, and for them to fit telehealth appointments into their traditional workflow means to give them a helping hand; one way is to design a solution that incorporates unified communications tools like “presence awareness” into the solution to make it easy and intuitive to use.

## Communications Security.
From an technical perspective, telehealth takes things to a whole new level; with telehealth, healthcare organizations are combining video, data and voice in both wired and wireless formats, yet they must maintain the same levels of security and always-on availability that they provide for their data-only networks.

## Endpoint or Device Flexibility.
For Physicians in a clinical environnement a single web based or tablet endpoint may be fine; if the solution is intended to communicate with patients in their home environments or clinicians outside the organization, however, a multiple mobile device approach is mandatory.
