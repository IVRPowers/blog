**Telemedicine** services are increasing year by year. The main reason is  **Real-time communications [(RTC)](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-rtc/)** technology is becoming a great way to connect doctors and medical facilities with patients. Through a **video conference session** the patient can show his swollen ankle, and on basis of that image, doctor can decide whether an appointment is advisable.

## Telemedicine

Telemedicine is not an answer to everything, but **consumers see web-based or mobile application visits more convenient** to get treated for minor ailments, such as allergy symptoms, coughs, flu or bug bites. It also allows patients to receive a continued care outside of traditional office hours. **[Video RTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc/)** can be the best option regarding post hospitalization follow-up or different doctor’s appointments, for instance, nutritionists, dermatologists, pediatricians and psychiatrists. Possibilities are unlimited.

## Convenient, Efficient and Cost-Saver

Doctors who talk to patients through Video RTC have access to patient’s medical history and they watch the problem on the screen. Access to specialists is faster. And thanks to **[WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/)** technology doctors can get in touch easily with specialized physicians to share opinions and diagnosis.
 
The truth is telemedicine can transform medicine into a more convenient, efficient and cost-saver service, while **preserving or enhancing the quality of care**.
