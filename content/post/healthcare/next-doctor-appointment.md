Telemedicine services are increasing year by year. The main reason is video chat. Real-time communications **[(RTC)](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-rtc/)** technology is a great way to connect doctors and medical facilities with patients. Through a video chat the patient can show his swollen ankle, and on basis of that image, doctor can decide whether an appointment is advisable.
 
Telemedicine is not an answer to everything, but consumers see web-based or mobile application visits more convenient to get treated for minor ailments, such as allergy symptoms, coughs, flu or bug bites. It also allows patients to receive a continued care outside of traditional office hours. **[Video RTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc/)** can be the best option regarding post hospitalization follow-up or different doctor’s appointments, for instance, nutritionists, dermatologists, pediatricians and psychiatrists. The possibilities are numerous.

And thanks to **[WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/)** technology doctors can get in touch easily with specialized physicians to share opinions and diagnosis.
