There is no greater need for a personalized customer experience than in healthcare. But, at the same time, busy patients demand new ways to communicate with their doctors to save time. Thanks to technology innovations, telehealth can make health care easier for patients. 

#### Why should healthcare industry take advantage and adapt to technology trends?


 **Time-saver** Telemedicine allows to save time spent traveling to doctorâ€™s office and waiting for the appointment. It is calculated that [70% of physician visits could have been handled by a phone call.](http://www.benefitspro.com/2015/02/11/the-growth-of-telemedicine?slreturn=1498726991) Remote visits by phone or video chat is more convenient for minor ailments.

 **Better access** Telemedicine is a crucial strategy for getting more patients access to the healthcare they need, for instance, to rural areas. Rural patients receiving care via telehealth can avoid driving long distances. And thanks to real-time communications small rural hospitals can continue providing quality care at low costs.

 **More services** The use of real-time interactive telecommunications technology also allows to implement a broader scope of health care services, including information, training and education.
