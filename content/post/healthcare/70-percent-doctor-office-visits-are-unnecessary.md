According to a recent study by *PricewaterhouseCoopers*, **one in four people indicate that it takes more than 30 days to get an appointment with their physician**. Many of these cases result in an unnecessary visit to the emergency room. Overall, **the total cost of unnecessary emergency room visits is just under $14 billion annually**. One of the most common reasons for these unnecessary visits include patient convenience, symptoms that occur after hours or on the weekend, or the patient was unable to get a timely appointment with their physician. According to the Wellness Council of America, **70 percent of all doctor’s office visits are unnecessary, and 66 percent of all ER visits are non-emergencies**.
