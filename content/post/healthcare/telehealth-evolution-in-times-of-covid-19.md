If you need to see a doctor any time soon and it's unrelated to COVID-19, chances are that your visit will be a virtual one. Today the people is open to the idea of seeing a doctor virtually instead of an in-person visit, there are a  positive momentum and that awareness has increased. When a virus outbreak occurs, diagnosing patients promptly, minimizing travel time, and reducing public exposure helps to curb the rate of infection. Telehealth consultations are a means to achieve these ideal care conditions during times of increased public health concern.

Under the current circumstances of a shortage of physicians and specialists, telehealth can provide the prompt care required. Also, telehealth infectious disease consultations can reduce in-patient time following a diagnosisand improve safety options for those suffering from chronic disease, acute injuries and illnesses, or require urgent care.

##	Telehealth is now a real new opportunity for healthcare.

As of today, the telehealth, and broader healthcare community, is fluid, dynamic and constantly evolving.
