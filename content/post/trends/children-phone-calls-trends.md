###### Source: Survey from Ofcom ,the UK's communications regulator

**Children 6-15 years old, in average of a week with any device and from any location in UK, only spent 2% of their communicating time with phone calls**. That's not really a suprise, if you know some children of this age in a country like UK or any other one... but **think about what will be the real-time communication market in the next 10 years under this generation**. Is there any possibility to continue using phone calls as the main customer care channel? In 2027, could it really used for anything else than emergencies?
