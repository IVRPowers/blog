[The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way we live, work and shop](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/trends/how-customer-behavior-has-changed-during-the-pandemic/), it has created a need for new methods of engagement between contact centres and customers. **Customers no longer care about the brands** that they had been loyal for years, they simply want to shop in a safe, efficient and convenient manner; **experience matters now more than ever**.

##	Hyper-personalization 
This is an incredible opportunity for brands to show up for their customers and provide an extra level of ease and personalization. Not only are customer interactions shifting online, but **growing demand for hyper-personalisation** is putting extra pressure on customer service teams and increasing the need for new workflows. 

##	Web Collaboration 
Adding communication tools like Video Calling with **Live Chat, File Sharing, Screen Sharing,  CoBrowsing, Video Messaging** are  providing contact centre teams with the tools and support they need to solve these challenges and succeed in their new roles.  Seeing a representative during an interaction promotes trust and confidence increasing online sales conversions while maintaining a personal connection.

##	Efficiency and Loyalty
Helping businesses to innovate and deliver a **more empathetic experience to their customers**. There’s no reason why we can’t leverage technologies like AI and orchestrations to really foster more empathetic experiences. And, seeing contact centres less in terms of efficiency and cost but more as an effective and empathetic place where you build customer loyalty and advocacy. 

##	Video Calling
Adding a Video Centric channel helps to create a better human connection for distinct audiences and situations. We’re making it easier than ever for organizations to deliver seamless agent and customer experiences, embrace remote and hybrid working, and track and improve their contact centre performance. **Video Channel is now the new Voice**.
