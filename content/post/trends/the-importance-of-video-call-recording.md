#	Why getting video recordings is key for a successful video contact center? Benefits, Implementation Considerations, and Recommendations
--- 

Currently, many companies are implementing video contact centers as a way to improve the customer experience. However, not all of these companies are fully taking advantage of the potential of this tool. One of the most important features to consider when implementing a video contact center is the ability to record customer interactions on video. In this post, we will explain why having video recording in a video contact center is so important and how it can improve the customer experience and business efficiency.

Benefits:

1. **Greater security**: By having video recordings of customer interactions, it can be ensured that service quality standards are being met and customer privacy is being respected. Additionally, in case of disputes, recordings can be reviewed to determine what exactly happened not only in conversation but also with all video frames.
2. **Improved service quality**: Video recording allows customer service agents to evaluate their own performance and receive feedback from supervisors. By seeing their own interactions with customers, agents can learn from their mistakes and improve the way they handle non-verbal communication situations that are so important for good care.
3. **Strengthened customer relationship**: The ability to have video recordings of customer interactions allows companies to identify customer needs and preferences, allowing them to offer more personalized solutions. Additionally, the fact that customers know they are being recorded can discourage agents from behaving inappropriately and improve customer trust in the service.

There are several important aspects to consider when implementing a video call recording system in a contact center, including:

##	#1. Regulatory compliance

It is important for the recording system to comply with applicable regulations and laws. For example, if it is a contact center handling credit card information, **the system must comply with payment card industry security standards and comply with data privacy laws**. Be sure to research relevant regulations in your country or region and choose a recording system that complies with them.

##	#2. Recording quality

Recording quality is essential for the recording system to be effective. There must be adequate image and sound quality RAW/SD/HD so that customer interactions can be properly heard and seen. Additionally, it is important to ensure that **the recording system has sufficient capacity to store high-quality recordings** without degrading the quality of the image and sound.

##	#3. Security of recordings

It is important for recordings to be securely protected to prevent any manipulation or loss. **There must be robust security measures throughout the life cycle of recordings**, from storage to deletion. Recordings must be encrypted and stored in a secure location to ensure customer privacy and comply with data privacy regulations.

##	#4. Access and management of recordings

It is essential for the recording system to allow for efficient and secure management of recordings. For example, **supervisors should be able to easily access and search recordings for audit or staff training purposes**. Additionally, recording export should be allowed according to company needs. It is important for the system to allow the definition of data management rules in accordance with applicable legislation.

##	#5. Integration with the contact center system

First, the recording system must be fully integrated with the contact center system to ensure a seamless recording experience for the data of record. **This should include integration with video call metadata, audio recording, and the ability to pause or resume recording** in parts as needed to maintain all video call workflow transfers.

##	#6. Massive long-term data archiving

The ability to archive large volumes of recordings long-term is essential for auditing and regulatory compliance. **The recording system must have massive storage capacity and allow for efficient and secure management of archived data**. Additionally, it is important for the system to allow for scheduled deletion of old recordings that are no longer required.

##	#7. Programmable automatic export

The recording system must allow for programmable export of recordings according to company needs. For example, it may be necessary to export all recordings from a specific period in a specific format for later analysis. It is important for the system to **allow for programmable automated export of recordings in different formats** and configurable according to company requirements.

##	#8. Perform forensic audits of recordings

The ability to perform forensic audits of original RAW recordings is essential to verify compliance with regulatory requirements, identify quality of service and/or fraud issues, and analyze any other relevant situation. **The recording system should allow for the review and analysis of recordings with advanced auditing or visualization tools** to facilitate the identification of patterns or anomalies. In addition, it is important that the system allows the configuration of the auditing tools to adapt to the specific needs of the company.
