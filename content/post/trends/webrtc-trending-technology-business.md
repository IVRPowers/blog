Technology is continuously changing our daily tasks. We pay bills, book concert tickets, buy food and even we can control our home from a device. People, especially younger generations, expect technological innovations in their everyday life. It happens so in business and ignoring this reality will lead to loss of potential and therefore of competitiveness.
 
Technology solutions have a great impact on **Customer Experience**. And one of the latest trends in the field is **#WebRTC**. It can improve interactions between the company and its clients, providing immediate assistance and advice support. It is also a cost-saving option to doctors, who can virtually visit for patient-monitoring. Video conferencing solutions can also be applied in hiring processes and it is an excellent option for distance learning.
 
**WebRTC** enables real-time communication, such as video conferencing, file transfer or chat. The main advantage is face to face communications. Thanks to video assistance customers do not necessarily have to move to points of sale and in-person interactions allows a better understanding and empathy.
 
Transparency Market Research predicts that the video conferencing market will expand [during 2014 to 2020 from a value of US$ 3.31 billion to US$ 6.40 billion.](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/12/04/793038/10157897/en/Video-Conferencing-Market-to-Expand-at-9-3-CAGR-to-2020-Thanks-to-Increasing-Usage-in-Healthcare-and-Defense-Transparency-Market-Research.html ). Opportunities for video usage are growing every day. Education, healthcare industry, financial services, government and defence, e-commerce or contact centres can improve their services enhancing interactions with customers.
