Most Call Centers are only managing standard inbound phone calls with the addition of "Click-to-call" or "Call-me-back" buttons. It's a very interesting "work around" option but it's not enough. More and more users don't like to make a phone call when they are browsing the net. 

Users just want to keep on the same channel for many reasons:

1. they don't want to unveils their phone number…  
2. they don't know if one agent will be available now or better later…
3. they don't want to leave their web session context...
4. they may have bad cellular coverage conditions to make a mobile call...
5. they may be traveling outside their country under expensive roaming conditions… 
6. they may not be able to explain properly their current webpage context…

That's a lot of reasons to make any inbound phone service fail?

Obviously, Call Centers have to think more about receiving direct calls from any webpage with or without video. The next evolution is to become a Multimedia (or Video) Contact Center providing on demand face-to-face interaction or receiving any kind of voice calls or video calls and with agent's presence status. We have two good news: first, it won't require specific "rocket science" technology and second, it's not for next century...

**It's ready for now!**
