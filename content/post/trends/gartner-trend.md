# By 2018, more than 100 out of the 500 largest Global Businesses will implement Video Chat.

Time is the new currency for your customers who are looking for painless and informed solutions to their issues. We are also starting, growing and running companies in an "attention economy," which is defined by the view that human attention is a scarce commodity. **By 2018, according to research from Gartner, more than 100 out of the 500 largest global businesses will have implemented video chat**. Digital transformation does not mean that Twitter avatars and chatbots (although they are driven by increasingly intelligent knowledge bases) must fully take the place of actual humans speaking to other humans, even for companies that may have millions of users.
