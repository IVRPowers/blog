# The Interactive Voice Response (IVR) market is growing, but what’s driving that growth?

Market research analysts from Technavio suggest that the **[IVR](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-ivr/), or Interactive Voice Response market, will see a growth of around 13% between this year, and 2021**. For those who are new to the industry, IVR systems are the solutions that give companies a stronger way of engaging their customers through various customer service solutions. A lot of enterprises today have begun to adhere to open standards, recognising how important it can be to deliver new technologies that work seamlessly alongside existing products. **The arrival of “Voice Extensible Markup Language”, or [VoiceXML](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-voicexml/), has helped to boost application development in the business world thanks to improved speech recognition**. The ability to use standard codes means that using IVR is simpler, and ensures that customers can integrate their systems with other vendor solutions.
