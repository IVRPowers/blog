# TCO is particularly important when you’re deploying Video RTC solutions, and it allows companies to gain substantial cost advantages in implementation, training, maintenance, and system management.

Most analysts agree that on-premises will cost you less up front. You pay a one-time license fee, along with a maintenance subscription covering things like vendor support. These are far cheaper than the cost of your cloud subscription over time. However, the biggest error when evaluating on-premise’s total cost of ownership (TCO) is to forget to factor in ongoing costs. According to them, the annual cost to own and manage software apps can be up to four times the cost of the initial purchase.
