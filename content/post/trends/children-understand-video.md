#	Video Real-Time Communications are not optional for younger generations.
---

If you have the opportunity to check how children understand Live Communications, you will quickly realise that phone is absolutly not a priority for them. They will never ask you about using a phone number and never want to remember just what it is. **This new generation is born under a full digital world's devices with high speed Internet and they absolutly are not aware about using limited or poor interactions**. For this reason, they jut feel like boring waiting for a specific content by email, a TV show or making a simple phone call when they have the capacity to get rich interactions with video, text, smileys or pictures in real-time.

> Children are not wrong, they are the Future.  

## Evolution not an option.

Companies that doesn't understand yet that [Real-Time Communications (RTC)](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-rtc/) have to progresively replace all phone calls in the next years for their customer care, sales or support will become quickly old fashioned and irrelevant for these new consumers. The next customer generation will never accept to downgrade their high speed and rich communication expectations.

> It's not a question of fashion, it'a a question of evolution.
