#	Children feel more confortable having video calls than phone calls.
---

If you have the opportunity to check how children understand Live Communications, you will quickly realise that phone is absolutly not a priority for them. They will never ask you about using a phone number and never want to remember just what it is. **This new generation is born under a full digital world's devices with high speed Internet and they absolutly are not aware about using limited or poor interactions**. For this reason, they jut feel like boring waiting for a specific content by email, a TV show or making a simple phone call when they have the capacity to get rich interactions with video, text, smileys or pictures in real-time.

> Children cannot being wrong, they are the Future.
