# A new web standard makes it possible to sign into virtually any web service without needing a password!
---

This [Authentication standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) from [W3C](https://www.w3.org) will use your fingerprint reader or inside camera in a wide variety of web browsers. That, in turn, lets you access virtually any online service in a PC or mobile device through password-free FIDO Authentication, not just specific services. You can continue to use familiar biometrics methods like fingerprint readers, cameras and USB keys, and it can serve both in place of and in addition to passwords. The functionality is useful right now in Mozilla's Firefox browser, and should come to both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge in the "next few months." Opera has also publicly committed to the technology (there's no mention of Apple bringing it to Safari).

We are now closer to a world without passwords, you can also deploy more  specific RTC services thanks to [Biometric Facial Recognition](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/facial-recognition/) in combination with our [Video RTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc/) solutions.
