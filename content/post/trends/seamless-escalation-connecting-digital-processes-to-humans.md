#  The strategic integration of AI with human attention revolutionizes today's Contact Centers, ensuring expert care right when the customer needs it.
---

In contact centers, automated processes have grown in recent years driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) —chatbots, social media auto-responses, or conversational IVR systems— streamline customer service, although they cannot solve all user needs. **Seamless Escalation** allows transitioning from these processes to human attention or **Human Intelligence** (HI) naturally, staying in a digital channel through real-time communication via voice, video, and text. This approach is key for contact centers to evolve and better respond to user needs. According to a Gartner report, by 2025, half of contact center interactions will be handled by automated processes with artificial intelligence, making it essential to effectively connect these systems with humans to maintain a quality experience [Gartner, 2023] and avoid frustration with incorrect or inadequate automated responses. Currently, most companies try to direct these interactions to the telephone channel, although it is not prepared to properly manage conversations initiated in chat, web pages, mobile applications, or other digital systems where users interact with AI.

## Service Processes: The Limits of AI Automation

Automated processes, based on artificial intelligence, can handle up to 80% of user queries, such as verifying order status, accounts, tickets, or answering frequent questions. However, the remaining 20% —complex technical situations, emotional problems, empathy issues, or ethical decisions— require human intelligence, which provides understanding and empathy. A PwC study reveals that **75% of customers prefer to talk to a person to solve complex problems** [PwC, 2022]. Without fluid escalation within automated digital channels, contact centers risk user satisfaction.

## Seamless Escalation: Key to Positive CX Evolution

Seamless escalation facilitates a natural transition from automated digital processes to human attention. Real-time communication (RTC) allows choosing the most appropriate channel: voice for conveying empathy, video for face-to-face explanations, or live text for written support responses. This integration ensures effective resolution without interrupting the process. As an example, online banking contact centers that implement real-time communication to verify identity and reactivate passwords in complex situations achieve customer satisfaction of 9.5 out of 10. Human intelligence (HI) manages emotions and makes decisions beyond automated capabilities, while real-time communication provides the immediacy that generates that wow effect.

## What Customers Expect: "I Want to Talk to an Agent..."

The lack of direct access to human representatives in customer service generates significant frustration among users. Market research data clearly confirms this: according to a Gartner study, 40% of consumers are dissatisfied with the increasing difficulty in contacting a real agent in current contact centers [Gartner, 2023]. Seamleass escalation emerges as a comprehensive solution, operating through omnichannel systems that monitor interactions and precisely detect where and when a customer needs personalized attention. This allows for immediate and frictionless connection with a trained agent, whether by voice, video call, or instant messaging. The e-commerce sector well illustrates its effectiveness: when complex situations occur, such as delivery delays or order discrepancies, timely human intervention makes a crucial difference. This real-time communication ([**RTC**](https://interactivepowers.com/en/platforms/videortc)) not only facilitates active listening and effective resolution but also reduces complaints, increases ratings, and strengthens trust in companies.

## Conclusion

Automated processes driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI), although highly efficient, will only cover 80% of interactions in future contact centers. Human intelligence (HI) is and will be essential for the remaining 20%, where empathy, emotional handling, or resolution of personal situations is required. A **seamless escalation**, supported by real-time communication as we develop at [**Interactive Powers**](https://www.interactivepowers.com/) through voice or video systems: responsive web, mobile apps, and devices such as screens, tablets, or interactive kiosks, is fundamental to effectively solve complex problems and preserve user satisfaction. Gartner projects that contact centers that do not implement this connection between automated and human processes could lose their omnichannel character and up to 30% of their customers to competitors who do [Gartner, 2023]. This approach embodies the future of customer service: efficient, fluid, and personalized, with the human element present when the situation demands it.
