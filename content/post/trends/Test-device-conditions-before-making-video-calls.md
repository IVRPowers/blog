In the digital communication era, video calls have become a fundamental tool for companies that offer advanced customer services or customer support as well. However, often these video calls can present technical and network issues that can affect the quality of communication and the user's experience.

That is why it is essential to have a **Tester** application that tests the communication conditions, web browser, audio devices, microphone, and bandwidth available before making a video call with Internet users in a service open to the public. We recommend this for three main reasons:

##	#1. Protect the reputation of your brand or customer service

Protecting the reputation of your brand or customer service is crucial in today's digital environment, where any bad experience can be shared through social networks or online reviews. Video calls are an excellent way to offer close and personalized customer service, but if the quality of communication is not optimal, it can generate frustration and mistrust in the user, resulting in a bad image for the brand. Therefore, by having an adequate **Tester** procedure, the quality of communication is guaranteed, and the brand or customer service's confidence is maintained.

##	#2. Reduce operational and technical support costs

In addition to ensuring smooth and quality communication for video calls, having this **Tester** tool can also help companies reduce operating and technical support costs. Potential problems can be detected or warned before they affect the user's and service agent's experience. In this way, this option allows greater anticipation and even basic configuration errors or network situations to be solved before they affect service provision and productivity.

##	#3. Guarantee a quality communication experience

A **Tester** application also ensures a high user experience or gains customer satisfaction by allowing service users to have greater security and confidence when making their video calls. By guaranteeing that all technical conditions are controlled in optimal conditions before starting a video call in a critical service attention, we are achieving a higher score and positive recommendation by users with greater frequency.

Conclusion: 

In conclusion, having a **Tester** application that tests communication conditions, web browser, audio devices, microphone, and bandwidth is essential to guarantee smooth and quality communication in video calls in a service open to the public. This can have a positive impact on the reputation and performance of the company, as well as on customer satisfaction and the user experience.
