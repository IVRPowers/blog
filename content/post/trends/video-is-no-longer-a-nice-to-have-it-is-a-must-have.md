Just one year ago, we had annouced that [Video was no longer "a nice to have" for Call Centers](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/trends/video-is-no-longuer-a-nice-to-have-for-call-centers/), now it will change the entire world market permanently.

As you may read in the research analyts reports, **Video was just representing no more than 8% or less of business communications** according to "more optimistics" predictions published past year as usual... Even, if video was much better than voice for any digital real time human interaction.

Today in April 2020, the disruptive impact of COVID-19 and the deep challenges it presents are difficult on a personal and business level, with widespread implications for how we work, we  purchase, we get services, we travel, the events we could attend in our communities and much more. We cannot to take anymore in account figures projected about real-time video, obsously next ones will be totally different.

Today, **Video is no longer a “nice to have” for any kind of business involving humans transactions**, it’s now the next great thing for real-time interactions to ensure continious  speed, emotion, security with humans to humans business communications.

All this means that most existing business communications processes have to be rethinked and reinvented to enable economy to restart faster and safely for all mankind.
