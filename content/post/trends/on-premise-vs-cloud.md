# There is many reasons to consider replacing an on-premises infrastructure with a cloud-based video real-time communication platform as a service.
---

If your communication infrastructure don’t supports modern video communications or faces end-of-life, you need to plan your migration strategy now to avoid pitfalls down the road. Also consider the seasonality of your business and the best time to be upgraded. For reference, on-premises solutions typically require more time to procure, generally weeks or months. While cloud solutions can be implemented in less than a week, you’ll want to plan enough time to set up trials and evaluate each service before making your decision. Here are main key reasons to consider replacing your on-premises infrastructure with a cloud-based video service like our CPaaS or SaaS.

### Flexibility.

Since today’s workforce is no longer tied to the office, employees need to stay connected when they work from home or travel. A cloud-based service lets them talk to anyone, on any device, from any location – whether using a video system in the conference room, or joining via phone anywhere.

###  Security.

By registering your video systems to a cloud subscription service, you can keep meetings secure behind your corporate firewall with encryption. You can also access other security features like PIN codes, locking meeting rooms, and one-time-use rooms. Read more about security for video conferencing here.

### Scalability.

As your business grows, a cloud-based video solution can grow with you. There’s no need to purchase additional hardware or ports; simply add new users or channels to your existing subscription. All our Cloud Hosting approach is powered by an AWS elastic computing.

### Interoperability.

You may already have existing communication technologies inside your company and you have to keep running all your processes. There’s no need to change all systems to add video capabilities; simply connect any kind of endpoints like Kiosks, Web Browsers, Smartphones or Tablets... quickly and easily.

### Quality.

One of the biggest reasons to invest in hardware is the quality, but did you know you can keep the same high-quality experience using the cloud? With the right Cloud Computing provider, you don’t have to worry about dropped calls, choppy audio, or frozen faces. 

### User-friendly.

Unlike the days of complicated AV installations, you can register an endpoint to the cloud in seconds and get users up-and-running quickly. You can customise the UX of your endpoint, thanks to special SDK and API Framework to match closely with your customer experience.
