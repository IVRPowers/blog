# Direct Human Communication Has a Premium Effect in the AI Era
---

If the cost per minute of an employee is practically identical regardless of channel (text, voice, or video), why do we continue using them predominantly in the channel with the lowest emotional bandwidth?

Competing with AI in text or voice speed is a battle lost from the start. Humans have no rival in empathy, intuition, and nonverbal communication. That's where their insurmountable competitive advantage lies.

2025 industry reports (Global Growth Insights) project growth exceeding 14% CAGR in video-support and video-banking services, driven exclusively by one factor: the trust that only visual human presence generates during **Transaccional Video Calls**.

High-impact cases where video multiplies results:

✅ **Banking and Insurance:**
> High-commitment financial products close by looking clients in the eye and explaining the fine print with transparency.

✅ **Healthcare and Telemedicine:**
> The professional's visual presence demonstrably reduces patients anxiety and improves treatment adherence.

✅ **Tourism and Hospitality:**
> Experiences and emotions are sold; a human agent on video creates memories that a bot can never replicate.

✅ **Luxury and High-Ticket Retail:**
> Video-assisted conversion multiplies the closing rate by 3-4 times compared to any phone call or e-commerce.
