#	Companies must recognize CX as a key competitive differentiator and make sweeping changes in the Channels to keep up this year.
---

In the last years, **digital technologies have changed the way we work and relate to each other.** These changes have also impacted on customersâ€™ expectations. Clients increasingly demand a more personalized, accessible and comfortable attention.

## Daily Business Communications.

Clients expect from companies the possibility of contacting them through the same variety of channels they use in their everyday life communications. **Interactions through voice, messages or video have become common ways of contact.** Users move naturally from one to another, depending on whether they need to communicate brief and direct information, deliver a document, give a long explanation or display something in motion.

## Seamlessly Integrated Communications.

In 2018, companies will face the challenge of providing customers with the channels they already routinely use in their personal communications and at work. In the coming years, **Video will be key in communications,** and therefore **the incorporation of WebRTC technology** will be an unavoidable step for contact centres. However, companies will have to pay attention to appropriately implement it. The provision of new channels should not involve a complete transformation of the services provided, but should be [integrated into existing platforms and work flows.](

) On the other hand, companies will have to conceive the new channels in real time as [a single escalation process,](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/customerengagement/escalating-communications/) which will ensure that the maximum benefit is successfully obtained.
