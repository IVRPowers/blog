# Rethinking Text Chat Support in Contact Centers
---

Over the past decade, the customer service industry prioritized concurrency in text channels—live chat, WhatsApp, and tickets—under the belief that an agent could efficiently handle 3 or 4 conversations simultaneously. Today, with the maturity of Generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs), that premise has become obsolete.

The data from 2024-2025 is conclusive: maintaining human agents on routine text tasks represents an inefficient use of talent. AI processes, interprets, and responds in milliseconds with superior contextual precision, eliminating wait times and unnecessary friction in 80% of inquiries.

The real breakthrough is not forcing humans to compete with machines in text mode, but rather relocating them where they generate the most value: rich, human interaction through video calls.

Strategic advantages of escalating to video calls:

✅ **Immediate resolution:**
> A problem that requires 15 messages and 20 minutes in chat is resolved in 3 minutes of face-to-face conversation.

✅ **Converting cost into investment:**
> The agent who previously managed 4 mediocre interactions simultaneously now dedicates their full attention to high-value customers, closing sales, retaining accounts, or resolving complex conflicts with exponentially superior ROI.

✅ **Authentic emotional connection:**
> Visual presence and non-verbal language generate immediate trust that no text or synthetic voice can replicate.

✅ **Measurable results:**
> In e-commerce and technical support, live demonstration drastically reduces returns, abandonment, and follow-up tickets.
