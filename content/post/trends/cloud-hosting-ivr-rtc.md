# Upgrade your business communications to the Cloud to deliver more value with less costs
---
 
Computing based on the internet is booming business. [The global cloud communication market is projected to reach $4.45 by 2021](http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-communication-platform-market-227618526.html). **Why are more and more companies turning to the cloud for their business communications needs?**
 
## Communications solutions at a lower cost.
 
Cloud computing is a cost saver since it can reduce or even **eliminate the need for a company to buy an expensive hardware and software**. Many companies offer huge computing capacity on the Cloud and are already making its software available on it (SaaS or CPaaS). Because there is a lower infrastructure, maintenance costs are dramatically reduced as well.
 
## Work and manage remotely.
 
Cloud computing changes the way businesses work. It grants more freedom to employers and employees as **it helps companies master remote working**. Thanks to the cloud you can improve efficiency. Your employees can work from anywhere at any time, which also means that you can hire employees around the world as applicants do not need to move or be located in the same city.
 
## Flexibility at convenience
 
You take advantage of scale, but you only pay for the resource usage you need. [Cloud Hosting](http://www.ivrpowers.com/cloud-hosting/) services are billed on **a pay-as-you-go basis**. If your needs increase, you can easily scale up cloud capacity or scale it down. Therefore, is an ideal solution for growing companies or businesses with fluctuating demands.
