# Nearly one-third of Contact Centers expect to deploy Video Chat to improve Customer Engagement

According to a research from Dimension Data, nearly one-third of contact centers expect to deploy video chat for customer engagement. **The research says that giving customers the additional option to remotely connect face-to-face, at moments that are important to them (and on their terms), can make their customer experience even more powerful**. For example, bank customers or credit union members today may not feel the need to be face-to-face with an employee in the event of a fraudulent transaction appearing on their card. However, in the event of a major financial milestone (like planning for college, launching a small business or buying a home), people want to be one-on-one with another human being.
