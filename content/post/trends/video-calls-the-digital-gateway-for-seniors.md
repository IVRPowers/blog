#  A Strategic Opportunity for Companies to Better Connect with Senior Audiences.
---

Based on our international experience implementing video call services, we can highlight a significant market opportunity that many companies are overlooking: the senior segment.

## Breaking Down Myths about Technology and Older Adults

Contrary to the widespread belief held by many operations, marketing, or technology executives, we have found that there is no real digital barrier for this segment. Not only does this profile have access to devices, but their family members/close contacts also facilitate their use to support them. In fact, video calls are especially well-received by senior audiences for three fundamental reasons:

✅  **More effective communication**

> They provide a face-to-face experience that significantly surpasses traditional telephone interaction for senior individuals.

✅   **Convenience and accessibility**

> They eliminate the need for unnecessary physical travel, an aspect that is very important and prioritized in many cases for this user profile.

✅  **Social and economic inclusion**

> They facilitate access to services for people with mobility limitations and low economic resources, both being better served through this channel.

## Competitive Advantages for any Business

The implementation of video call services offers strategic benefits:

✅  **Enhanced transactional security**

> Enables visual identity verification, significantly reducing the risk of online fraud and impersonation.

✅  **Personalized or assisted service**

> Possibility to include family members or caregivers in the communication to streamline it from the senior person's home.

✅  **Market expansion**

> Enables better access to a growing demographic segment in many countries due to population aging.

✅  **Competitive differentiation**

> Positioning as an innovative digital company that is socially responsible towards its senior clients.

## Proven Results Across Multiple Sectors

Data shows that video call processing services are particularly successful in this segment, as evidenced by implementations in both public and private sectors. Companies that have adopted this strategy report very high satisfaction levels above any other channel, as well as increased loyalty rates as a result of introducing this service.

## Call to Action for Businesses and Governements

The time to act is now. Companies implementing video call services targeted at senior audiences will not only expand their customer base but also establish a significant competitive advantage in an increasingly digital market.
