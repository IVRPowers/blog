#	Comparing Standard VoiceXML and Call Flow Diagram implementation approach for Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Systems.
--- 

Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems are commonly used in many organizations to enhance customer service, increase efficiency, and reduce costs. There are different types of IVR systems available in the market, such as Standard VoiceXML IVR and Call Flow Diagram IVR. In this post, we will compare these two types of IVR systems.

## Standard VoiceXML IVR advantages

VoiceXML is a markup open standard language that is used to create voice applications for IVR systems. VoiceXML powered IVR systems use scripts with XML tags to define the call flow and interaction between the caller and the system. These scripts are written in a text editor and can be edited and modified as needed. VoiceXML scripts are platform-independent, which means they can be used with different IVR systems.

Pros:

1. **Platform Independence**: VoiceXML is a platform-independent language, which means your voice applications can be easily reused with any other IVR system that supports it.
2. **Ease of Development**: VoiceXML scripts can be created and modified using a text editor in a separate web server, making the development process easy, separated and very efficient.
3. **Flexibility**: VoiceXML scripts can be modified quickly and dynamically to incorporate new features, contents or make changes during the call flow itself.
4. **Integration**: VoiceXML can be integrated with other web-based applications or any kind of APIs, IA dialog enginesâ€¦ making it easier to incorporate complex data from different sources.

## Call Flow Diagram IVR advantages

IVR systems powered by call flow diagrams boxes use a graphical interface to define the call flow and interaction between the caller and the system. The user interface consists of a series of boxes that represent different steps in the call flow, and lines connect the boxes to indicate the sequence of the call flow. This type of IVR system is also known as a visual IVR.

Pros:

1. **Visual Representation**: The graphical interface used in this type of IVR system makes it easy to understand the call flow and interaction between the caller and the system.
2. **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: The flow diagram boxes can be easily dragged and dropped to create the call flow, making the development process easy and efficient for any user.
3. **Interactive edition**: The visual interface allows developers to create interactive and engaging call flows that can improve the caller's experience without coding.
4. **Collaboration**: The graphical interface allows multiple team members to work on the same call flow, making it easier to collaborate on IVR development.

## Key Takeaways about this Comparison Analysis

Both Standard VoiceXML IVR and Call Flow Diagram IVR are common approaches to designing and implementing interactive voice response (IVR) systems, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. The choice between these two types of IVR systems depends on the specific needs and requirements of the organization.

Standard VoiceXML IVR runs with a markup language used to create highly scalable efficient interactive voice response services, and it offers a great deal of flexibility and control over the flow and functionality of the system. It allows developers to create dynamic, interactive menus and prompts that can be customized based on user input and other factors. Additionally, VoiceXML is a widely recognized and widely used standard, which means that there are many tools and resources available to developers who are working with it.

On the other hand, Call Flow Diagram IVR is a visual representation of the IVR system's logic, usually created using flowcharting software. This approach is typically easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand, as it provides a clear, visual representation of how the IVR system works. Additionally, call flow diagrams can be useful for identifying potential issues and checking visually the performance of the system.

The best approach will depend on the specific needs and goals of the project. For developers who have experience with VoiceXML and want maximum flexibility, scalability, integration and control, Standard VoiceXML IVR may be the better choice. On the other hand, for stakeholders who are less technically savvy or for projects where clarity, quick editing, no code approach and simplicity are the top priorities, a Call Flow Diagram IVR may be more appropriate.
