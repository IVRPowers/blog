A [recent report](http://info.vidyo.com/embedded-video-conferencing-report-2017.html) reveals that those who plan to **incorporate video into their services will opt for a communication Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).** Up to 49% will provide video services in the next 12 months using a communication PaaS.

## Telemedicine and Insurance Professionals.

The report also shows that [the leading business in incorporating video is telehealth.](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/healthcare/next-doctor-appointment/) 47% of respondents embedded video into a telehealth application. Video offers numerous advantages to this sector. It allows patients to **receive attention at convenience** from the comfort of their homes and it helps health institutions to **significantly reduce costs.**

Digital transformation is also reaching insurance professionals. As stated in [surveys,](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171109005292/en/Research-Shows-70-Insurance-Professionals-Deploy-Video-Enabled) 70% of insurance professionals plan to initiate video-enabled services. The main objectives of incorporating video are **to improve the perception of the organization, increase customer satisfaction and provide a more efficient customer service.**


## What Industries Can Benefit from Video in Real-Time?

In essence, video in real-time **recreates the in-branch visits** with very similar results to a face-to-face experience. Due to these advantages the integration of video does not only benefit telemedicine or insurance businesses. Video-enable service is one of the trends for 2018, [crossing many businesses.](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc-industries/) According to the survey, coming in at second, with 40%, are team collaboration applications, and at third, customer engagement, where there are 32% of video use cases. Other applications where video is a trending channel include distance learning, technical support or field services.

In the coming year, we must be very attentive to the evolution of video in real-time and its integration via PaaS.
