#	Improving Video Calling performance and Customer Experience with professional Background Effects: Solid, Picture or Blur
--- 

In recent years, video contact center services have become increasingly popular as more and more businesses realize the benefits of being able to connect with customers face-to-face, even if they're not in the same physical location. With the pandemic accelerating the shift to remote work, the use of video calls has become a critical part of providing customer support, sales, and other services.

However, there are a number of challenges that come with using video calls for customer service. One of the most significant is the potential for distractions and interruptions. When a customer is on a call, they may be distracted by things going on in the background or by other people in the room. Additionally, the customer service agent may be distracted by their surroundings, making it more difficult for them to focus on the customer's needs.

To help mitigate these challenges, many businesses are now turning to background effects for video contact center services. These effects can be as simple as a solid color, blur effect or as complex as a virtual background that places the speaker in a different location. Here are some of the benefits and recommendations for using background effects in your video contact center service.

## 1. Reduce Distractions and Interruptions

As mentioned earlier, distractions and interruptions are some of the biggest challenges of video calls. Background effects can help reduce these distractions by eliminating or masking the visual cues that might distract the customer or agent. For example, if an agent is working from home and has a noisy pet moving around in the background, a background effect can help to mitigate that interference and help the customer focus on the conversation.

## 2. Enhance Professionalism

Background effects can also help enhance the professionalism of your video contact center service. A well-designed and appropriate background effect can help convey a sense of competence and expertise, which can be especially important when dealing with high-stakes conversations, such as sales calls or technical support.

## 3. Create a Consistent Brand Image

Using branded background effects can help create a consistent brand image across your video contact center service. This can help reinforce brand recognition and create a sense of trust and familiarity with your customers. Nowadays, this type of brand image quality is not only desired but also demanded by the final promoter of the service.

## 4. Personalize the Customer Experience

Background effects can also be used to personalize the customer experience by using a background that reflects the customer's interests or needs. For example, if a customer is calling about a vacation, the agent can use a background effect that features a beach or other vacation destination. These aspects are very effective in the attention process and still relatively little exploited by marketing managers.

## 5. Choose Appropriate Background Effects

When using background effects in your video contact center service, it's important to choose effects that are appropriate and not distracting. For example, a solid color, blur effect or a subtle pattern can be a good choice, while a busy or distracting backgroundÂ  or backgrounds with strong colors or distorting motifs may be less appropriate.

In conclusion, background effects for video contact center services can help reduce distractions and interruptions, enhance professionalism, create a consistent brand image, personalize the customer experience, and more. By choosing appropriate and effective background effects, businesses can improve their customer service and build stronger relationships with their customers.
