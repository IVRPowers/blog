### **Video calls: a Game Changer.**

In today's digital world; where most businesses are growing their online strategies with —basic chatbots, generic emails and web forms, social media, call centers—, the results generally end up being quite similar with the same rates of undecided customers and lost opportunities. Have you considered transforming your communications? Video calls bring a significant change in the way companies connect with their customers remotely, offering a powerful tool to stand out in the market. Whether you're marketing physical products, personalized services, or complex solutions on your website, integrating video calls can be the differentiating element that transforms your business and makes it a leader in your sector by changing the game.

### **The Challenge of Online Abandonment Rate.**

In the competitive digital environment, especially for businesses with unique or valuable products or services, cart abandonment represents a crucial challenge. According to the **Baymard Institute, 70% of users abandon their purchase due to insecurities**, while **Salesforce indicates that 87% give up when they can't find immediate answers**. For first-time buyers, doubts about products, services, or logistical processes —which they cannot try, consult, or experience— are decisive barriers. Trust becomes the key factor in closing the sale. Observe how even Apple has reopened physical stores to interact face-to-face with their customers, who then make online purchases with complete confidence. Would you like to achieve similar results without physical investment and enhancing your products from your online presence?

### **Digital transformation requires a Human Touch.**

In 2025, the rise of online commerce demands going beyond pure automation through recorded or textual content. Differentiated products and complex processes require customer service that stands out through human connection. Without it, your business will depend solely on word of mouth, growing gradually and losing a significant portion of traffic that could convert into sales. This is where **transactional video calls** make the difference. Far from being a luxury or a complex tool, they constitute a practical and effective solution for current e-commerce. They allow resolving queries in real-time, generate trust, and don't involve the high costs of a physical store. Our experience shows that this approach not only optimizes results but maintains efficiency comparable to phone or chat service, offering considerably superior benefits.

### **Scalability and Integration into existing Channels.**

Interactive Powers' transactional video calls offer a comprehensive solution: they don't solely depend on your customers clicking a help button. They integrate with your current conversational channels —Social Networks, Live Chats— and allow starting a video call from an existing conversation. For example, you can finish a query initiated on WhatsApp Business or from Instagram through a voice or face-to-face interaction, explaining the suitability of a product while your customer remains in the online store. This interoperability eliminates friction and transforms everyday interactions into opportunities to close sales or build loyalty with undecided customers. It's important to consider that most traffic abandoning carts without confirming corresponds to users who didn't receive an immediate response in channels that don't operate in real-time.

### **A Strategy that changes the Online Paradigm.**

Imagine your customers hesitating on your website about a garment, an accessory, or shipping details. A button appears: **"Talk to an expert"**. With one click, they connect via video call with an advisor who shows them the product, shares their screen, and facilitates closing the sale on the spot. With technologies like **Video RTC**, undecided visits —whether from SEO or within the store— transform into loyal customers without needing to expand your physical infrastructure. Companies comparing video call service with traditional channels report up to **35% more satisfaction** and **25% more conversions**, all without requiring additional operational resources. We invite you to verify it personally, as no voice or text service has matched the score or effectiveness of a transactional video call service.

### **Lead the Future of your online business Today.**

The growth of video calls is inevitable in an advanced digital environment: everything points towards this natural evolution. Limiting ourselves to more basic sensory interactions makes no sense —it would be like settling for the telegraph arguing that there was no need for more to adopt the telephone. The ability to transmit and receive video in real-time through current networks is a reality; the only obstacles are our own beliefs and the tendency to maintain the established. While other companies invest in physical spaces or stagnate in automation, your e-commerce can stand out by prioritizing service quality through the adoption of video calls to reposition itself in the market. With years of experience in RTC solutions, **Interactive Powers** accompanies you to transform each interaction into a sales opportunity. It's not just about technology, but about building better relationships that drive your business.
