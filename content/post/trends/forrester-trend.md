# 63 percent of US adult callers report to use the voice channel for self-service (IVR)

According to a 2016 Forrester Research study, 83 percent of U.S. adult Internet users had a phone conversation with a customer service representative in the past year. **Sixty-three percent of them also reported using the voice channel for self-service, such as Interactive Voice Response ([IVR](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-ivr/)) systems** whose Conversational AI capabilities enable callers to converse with a virtual agent as if there were a human rep on the other end. Itâ€™s not that one set of research is wrong. Just the opposite: Digital interactions are growing exponentially, but not at the expense of voice engagement. Savvy marketing and customer service professionals are balancing their strategies and budgets accordingly.
