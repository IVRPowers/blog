Customer experience is more important than ever. While brands that focus on getting an excellent service are immediately rewarded, a poor customer service highly damages companies: disloyalty, bad image and loss of money are some of the serious consequences. Because of it, according to Forrester, [72% of businesses say improving customer experience is their top priority](https://www.forrester.com/72+Of+Businesses+Name+Improving+Customer+Experience+Their+Top+Priority/-/E-PRE9109 )
 
Some challenges present an opportunity to **add strategic value to your business.** Let’s see five trends that can help you to maximize the benefits of a good customer service.
 
### Personalization

Track customer preferences is easier thanks to technology. Big data can offer a lot of information such as personal trails, demographic information, psychographic details or interaction history that serves to personalize the customer journey. **A good use of data allows to keep up with customers’ expectations.**
 
### Internet of Things

More and more devices are embedded with the ability to engage users. **By 2020 it is expected to be 50 billion connected devices globally.** IoT has the potential to help companies to speed up response time and to make the access to customer service more convenient and easier.

### Cloud-based platform

The Cloud is not broadly known by companies yet, but its adoption is expected to grow rapidly. A wide implementation will alter the way companies operate. It will impact on deployment of **most advanced communication software**, handle of upgrades and data management.

### Convergence

The lack of new channels can make your business lose money. Contact Centers have to add new value, for instance, **by merging telephony and internet services.** WebRTC technology, which turns the browser into a voice or video telephone, [opens new opportunities.](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/marketing/webrtc-system-benefits/ )

### Omnichannel

A true integration between channels will make the difference on customer experience. This approach offers the ability to have **a continuous experience,** eliminating the need to repeat an issue with every interaction and, therefore, saving customers’ time.
