Transactional video calls and video room meetings are two different forms of communication that have been made possible by modern WebRTC and SIP technologies. Transactional video calls are a form of one-on-one communication in real-time, while video room meetings are a form of group collaboration linked connection.

##	Transactional Video Calls

Transactional video calls enable two or three people to communicate with each other in real-time, and are typically used for professional conversations. **These calls can be transferred, meaning that each participant communicates together and it's possible to forward all the communication to the other person with a routing approach similar to phone calls**. This makes it easier to keep track of what has been said, as well as ensuring that everyone has a chance to express their opinion in a workflow with end to end video call recording.

Transactional video calls are the ideal choice for businesses that need to quickly and efficiently route multiple video calls to huge team of agents. This type of call queuing allows businesses to quickly and effectively manage and prioritize incoming video calls in customer care, as well as route them to the most appropriate agents. This can help ensure that all calls are answered in a timely manner, and helps to create a proactive positive customer experience.

##	Video Room Meetings

Video room meetings are used to facilitate a group communication and collaboration, as it allows for multiple people to join the same virtual space and discuss various topics. **These meetings can be used for work-related purposes, such as brainstorming ideas or having team meetings**. Unlike video calls, video room meetings are not transaccional, no video call transfer is possible as multiple people can be talking at the same time. This mainly allows for more ideas to be shared and discussed in a shorter amount of time.

One downside of video meetings is that it can be difficult to keep track of who said what and which ideas were discussed, especially when dealing with customer attention. In transactional video calls, the conversation flows and is each session is recorded in a more orderly fashion, similar phone call services, making it easier to keep track of who said what and ensuring that all participants have a chance to express their opinions. This helps to ensure that decisions are made efficiently and transactions are processed smoothly.
