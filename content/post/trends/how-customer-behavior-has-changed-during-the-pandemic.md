Customers are no longer caring about the brands that they had been loyal to for years, now they simply want to shop with brands that make their life easier and better, expecting clear and easy options for contacting any post-pandemic customer service. 

##	Remote Working is Required
Consumers are now building their whole lifestyles around their homes as centres of gravity where they work and stay healthy, shopping online more and **30% hope to work more from their home in the future**. Companies now need to understand where consumers are going next and be bolder in accelerating their transformation, been closer people live and building new communications  to provide very high expectations.

##	Customer Experience is First
According to Forrester companies that focus on customer experience have six times the profits of companies that don’t. The proof is out there that when we make people feel good they come back  not only do they come back they tell friends. **Nearly 80% of American consumers say that speed, convenience, knowledgeable help and friendly service are the most important elements of a positive customer experience**.

##	Human Interaction Matters Now
Human interaction matters much more now. **Today, 59% of all consumers feel companies have lost touch with the human element of customer experience** and one in four (25%) say being able to communicate via video would improve their customer service experience, especially when dealing with complex and emotional enquiries.  This situation is changing priority from voice only to video enhanced channels.
