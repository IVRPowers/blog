In a recent [Enghouse Interactive survey,](https://enghouseinteractive.co.uk/about/in-the-media/79-consumers-want-able-contact-businesses-online/) customers have made it clear that they **want online communication channels with companies.** 79% of consumers believe that businesses should provide a way for customers to contact them online.

It is also interesting to compare this figure with the responses to the very same question in previous years' surveys. In 2014, only 29% of respondents answered that the possibility to contact a company online was relevant.


## How can a company respond to customer demands?

The remarkable increase, in three years, in the number of customers who expect to be able to contact companies online shows that customers are prepared to use the new communication channels offered by the latest technological advances. It seems that customers go one step further than businesses. Companies should be very attentive to **the uses and requests of customers,** because they may be giving the key to differentiate themselves in the market in the coming years.
