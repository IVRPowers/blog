# Video AI agents with an human like behavior are closer than you may think…
---

Today, Xinhua, China’s state-run press agency, has unveiled new [“AI anchors”](https://youtu.be/GAfiATTQufk) — digital composites created from footage of human hosts that read the news using synthesized voices. 

The news anchor, based on the latest AI technology, has a male image with a voice, facial expressions and actions of a real person. **"He" learns from live broadcasting videos by himself and can read texts as naturally as a human**. This technology can be easily connected to a Video Call Center like our Video RTC platforms to manage a next level of customer interactions. Think about it, all of this Videobot integration and revolution is closer than you can imagine today for your business.

Be ready with your Call Center, **Voicebots are just the first wave, Videobots are already coming**.
