Just a few years ago, talking about artificial intelligence meant talking about a futuristic scenario. Today, AI is everywhere and, directly or indirectly, **we use it almost every day.** The rapid evolution of AI allows it to be increasingly applied to more sophisticated processes which require a high precision.


## What can AI do in the contact center?

In customer service, AI already works as an agent's assistant. It enables to collect information about customers, lead them to the right agent according to their needs and even solve basic requests. The application of AI to contact centers is growing, to the extent that Frost & Sullivan predict that, [by 2030, AI solutions will surpass the services provided by agents.](https://ww2.frost.com/files/8414/8138/2965/Picture1.png)


AI will help to save time and money and correctly integrate the variety of new channels that will be handled – [voice, messages, video – in the contact center.](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/contactcenter/video-integration/) Very soon, AI will be present in any customer service process, **helping to achieve the notion of omnichannel.** Contact centers must pay attention to the AI evolution and applications. Today it can be just a way to differentiate a company, but in a few years, it may become an essential solution for survival in the market.
