Beyond improving quality of service QoS and call productivity, any Contact Center has to be ready for the next Internet evolution challenges. For any online business or ecommerce website, the most efficient way to contact a sale representative or get human support is a real-time interaction with your agents but without leaving the web session, so you have to add a one-click button located near to the product or service or information they are selecting. The agent must receive a session ID from this caller to get the context.

Unfortunately, what's happen in the real world for online users is:

1. Find the right phone number to call (sometimes it's not easy to find it because email and forms are the first choice…)
2. Take a phone (taking care about calling rates from your cellular, so you may wait to call from a landline…)
3. Make a call to the phone number,… to be routed to a boring IVR with many interactions steps (Of course, an IVR can do better things like self-services…)
4. Wait for a while in the ACD queue… (all agents can be busy, so please wait….)
5. Finally when the call is transfered to an agent,  you have to explain at phone the visual context of your web session… 
6. Some times, the call can be hanged up (line error, bad coverage, ….) so you will have to redo all this steps and probably, your call will be transfered to another agent…

That's what most companies implements today. Do you really think, that's a good User Experience approach? Of course, not, the first reason of this situation, is that all Call Centers are based on telephony platforms or standard PBX. 

Videocall and Webcall over the Internet is the next big feature to increase the service value for most Contact Centers and make their services really different against competitors. Today, most users are often connected to Internet with their computers and mobile devices to get any online information about your company before purchasing products or services.
