###### Image source: Interactive Powers' elaboration

At past WWDC 2017 in San Jose, California, Apple announced that it will include **support for WebRTC in Safari 11 and WebKit for all iOS 11 and MacOS Sierra devices.** Until now, 80% of all browsers supported WebRTC including Firefox and Chrome. Regarding Safari it grows to 95%. Appleâ€™s announcement gives companies that use [WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/) applications and tools, such as our [VideoRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc/) solutions, a broader range for choice and flexibility over which browser their rich multimedia communications services are delivered. But its newfound pervasiveness is also good news for WebRTC itself. 


## What is supported in WebRTC for Safari 11.

What is important to know currently is which are the **limits or real possibilities.** Right now, in the WebRTC Safari implementation released by Apple are included:

* GetUserMedia and PeerConnection (the basics)
* Voice and video calls seem to work well
* Opus codec is allowed for audio
* H.264 is the only one codec allowed for video (there is no VP8 or VP9)
* Data Channel is supported, but is reported as buggy to be used apparently
* No screen sharing

## What are the Apple devices and OS.

WebRTC is here for both, desktop Safari 11 (MacOS Sierra iMac & Macbook) and mobile Safari (most iPhone and iPad upgraded to iOS 11). That's really great news!
