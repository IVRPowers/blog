All interactions cannot be managed by bots, since users, when facing with certain problems, need to contact a real agent. If consumer is not allowed to communicate with a person, it leads to frustration and the relation client-company is seriously damaged. At this point, **video offers contact centers the possibility of developing a very differential customer experience management.**


### Voice over IP does not mean digitalisation

Opportunities set by the current development of [Video RTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc/) technology are yet to be discovered. Most of Contact Centers have only skipped from analogue to digital telephone signals, disregarding potentiality of real-time connections over the Internet. **At Interactive Powers, we have understood that digital shift in the Contact Center is unavoidable.** It is unlikely that users will give up the use of these technologies, as they make it possible more comfortable and economical interactions. They also allow to carry out complex procedures without leaving home, without waiting in lines and receiving the same personalized attention as in face-to-face visit.


### Omnichannel with real-time video

Digitisation processes might appear a major challenge for Contact Centers, but at the same time they represent an opportunity to strengthen themselves in the market. From our customersâ€™ experiences, we know that, nowadays, **adapting to the new digital environment is an easier process** that brings great benefits. On the one hand, it is possible to transform telephone structures into genuine multimedia channels, without losing current infrastructures or investments. On the other hand, the capacity to respond satisfactorily to new user demands **allows companies to set themselves apart from their competitors** and obtain a better rank. Interactive Powers' proposal is to introduce a complete omnichannel experience with high quality video, while leveraging voice, webchat, email and social media channels.


### Digitalization as a new opportunity

**Digitalization has already happened and it is not going to turn it back.** At present, it remains as a pending task to discover and take advantage of the opportunities that new technologies offer to better resolve new market paradigms. **Major beneficiaries of digital transformation can be Contact Centers,** if they manage to provide services required by consumers.
