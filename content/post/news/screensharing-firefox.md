[Screen sharing]( http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc-screen-sharing/) is a very powerful feature that allows users to share in a screen or window any documents or application including images, videos, formsâ€¦ among other capabilities.

Until now, it was only supported in one browser, Chrome, which gives access to screen capture by writing an extension. The good news is that **we can now also access screen sharing in Firefox!**

With Firefox version 52 and upper, it is even easier, since we do **not need to build or install extensions.** Screen Sharing comes to our WebRTC Gateway. In the image below you can see how straightforward it is:
