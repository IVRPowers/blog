[Screen sharing]( http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc-screen-sharing/) is a very useful tool that allows users to share documents, including images, among other capabilities. However, in order to build screen sharing capabilities, first, it is necessary to build screen capture. Until now, it was only supported in one browser, Chrome, which gives access to screen capture by writing an extension. The good news is that **we can now also access screen sharing in Firefox!**

With Firefox version 52 it is even easier, since we do **not need to build or install extensions.** Screensharing comes to our webrtc gateway. In the image below you can see how straightforward it is:
