The spread of new communication behaviour among users is pushing companies to modify their contact channels with customers. At [Interactive Powers](http://www.ivrpowers.com/about-us/) we observe that adapting to an **increasingly digitized market** poses new challenges. However, it also **opens one door of opportunity for companies to improve and differentiate themselves.**

From our offices in Spain and the United States, we provide **solutions that facilitate secure and real-time multimedia interactions over the Internet.** We develop communication solutions that can help you to improve customer experience. Our products allow you to provide services with **a greater added value** than the current traditional channels. They are based on [Video RTC](http://videortc.ivrpowers.com/) communication platforms and voice automation technologies, such as [IVRs](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-ivr/), and are also available for cloud infrastructures. In Interactive Powers we give response to the **new online interaction needs of today's market,** following open standards such as [WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/), which will set the trend in the coming years. Both areas play a decisive role in the **digital transformation** of companies' communication channels.


## New Video Channels, Voice, Chat...

Some of the solutions that we develop at Interactive Powers are communication platforms. They include **video, voice and instant chat channels,** and features such as shared screen and file transfer. These platforms can be used from the **web** and from an **application for a tablet** or a **mobile phone**. Currently, one of our priorities is to attend the technological shifts that companies need to incorporate. Therefore, we make sure to facilitate adaptation and integration processes via [API](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/development/introducing-videortcjs-developers/), by deploying our products over existing IT structures. In this way, it is possible to address, easily and economically, **Digital Revolution of real-time communication channels** across multiple sectors of industry, commerce and services.
