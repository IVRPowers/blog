# Chrome 72+ goes into Unified Plan SDP (Phase 3)
---

Google is planning to change the [WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/) implementation from the current SDP format called "Plan B" to a standards format "Unified Plan" over [4 phases](https://webrtc.org/web-apis/chrome/unified-plan/).

**Chrome M72 version will be the first release to apply phase 3**, and will require to upgrade sonn our [Video RTC](https://www.ivrpowers.com/videortc/) platform to run properly all this new SDP format. From Interactive Powers, we are working on a compatible plan with the Unified Plan SDP format. 

In the meantime, we have released a specific library [VideoRTC.js 2.5.1 update](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/updates/update-video-rtc-js-2.5.1/)  to fix your current services running with Chrome 72+ and avoid to break any WebRTC request using the "Plan B" format. With this update, we force M65+ browsers to use "plan-b" semantics until the Unified Plan SDP is completely ready on all our platforms.
