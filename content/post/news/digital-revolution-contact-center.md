All of us, as consumers, are becoming increasingly familiar with the use of new channels. We must also take into account that the first generation of digital natives is entering into the market. However, **phone continues to be the most widely used channel in customer service and voice over IP technology.** This situation is specially extended in the Spanish business landscape. Despite the significant development of digital broadband connections, **the level of digitalisation is relatively low.** According to the World Economic Forum index, in 2016, Spain ranks 35th. In the European Union index, 15th.

## Digital Transformation in Contact Center is Unavoidable

The new digital transformation scenario is one of [Interactive Powers'](http://www.ivrpowers.com/) reasons for being. In 2015, after more than 15 years working in the automation of call services, we decided to found a new company. The aim is to help businesses to adopt **new digital channels**, such as [Video](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/trends/video-call-centers/), which will be key in telecommunications in the coming years.

Nowadays, the implementation of **a truly omnichannel infrastructure** is essential. New customer behaviour and expectations have been boosted by the popularization of highly advanced mobile devices and broadband Internet access. Users and customers are ready to use multiple digital channels, but they have also started **to prioritize modalities that are more convenient and accessible** to them. Many companies do not know how to respond or adapt adequately to the new online trends, and they end up delaying a transformation that will determine their survival. Through our everyday work at Interactive Powers we realize that our main goal is to help companies and their customer service centers to integrate the **new digital channels of multimedia communication in real timeâ€¦**
