+++


Recent promotion of Cloud API services by the dominant Internet service providers can lead to a substantial change in the use of legacy systems. Cloud-based services, which enable high-value-added interactions with voice, natural language, artificial intelligence, etc., will make it **possible to leave legacy software behind.**


Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft are starting to provide cloud-based services, which were just available to developers until now. The release of these APIS to companies **will speed up the processes and, above all, it will help to notably reduce costs.** Thanks to Cloud-based APIS, investments in licensing and maintenance are not necessary anymore and the cost is reduced since charges are based on usage. For the time being, we can only talk about a trend, but we should pay attention to its evolution, as **the impact on the market can be decisive in the coming years.**
