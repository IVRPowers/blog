Recent promotion of Cloud API services by the dominant Internet service providers can lead to a substantial change in the use of legacy systems and technologies. Cloud-based services, which enable high-value-added interactions with voice, natural language, artificial intelligence, etc., will make it **possible to leave existing solutions behind.**

## More Efficient and Cost-Saving.

Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft are starting to provide amazing cloud-based services to enterprises, which were just available to developers until now. The release of these Cloud-based API services to companies **will speed up the processes and, above all, it will help to notably reduce costs.** Thanks to Cloud-based API, investments in licensing and system maintenance are not necessary anymore and the cost is reduced since charges are based on usage. For the time being, we can only talk about a trend, but we should pay attention to its evolution, as **the impact on the market can be decisive in the coming years.**
