> What most companies still doing…

###	 DTMF Menus.

Most PBX use touch tone menus to select departments, services or key an extension. Of course, everybody may knows how to press a key, but **it’s not really confortable to do this with hands free**, driving or when you don’t get the right option…

###	Record a Voicemail.

When an extension is not answering or is out of time, your PBX system will probably generate a voicemail and hangup. **It’s a very frustrating scenario for many users** to leave a message without any chance to interact or get feedback.

###	 Call Queuing (Waiting On Hold).

Any PBX may use a queue when all agents or receptionist are busy; **this situation is wasting your callers time** and they'll only stay connected if they have a good reason to contact you, otherwise they could leave your phone service for ever.

###	Call Receptionist (Human).

Provide a human touch could be wonderful customer care, but remember this option may not be expected or valued by callers because it doesn't required during the call routing or getting the right extension. **Get connected easier and faster is the only first customer's outcome**.

> What we recommend to do… 

###	Natural Language Understanding (NLU).

Replace old DTMF menus by advanced [NLU](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-nlu/) dialogs to **deliver the best customer experience for your callers**. It also enables to use Machine Learning in order to train and improve continuously your system.

###	Conversational IVR.

**Humans dialogs are mostly conversational**, let your customers as they like to ask for a service or a person in your company. [Conversational IVR](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/conversational-ivr-applications/) enables smarter interactions that will empower your PBX routing better than ever.

###	Automatic Call Transfer.

Make call transfers to the right extension or to a cellular according to the destination context rules. **Don’t think it’s always better to send the call to an agent**. An [IVR](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-ivr/) with AI can work even better, without any delay and never putting On Hold your callers.

###	Virtual Assistant.

Enable a Virtual Assistant (Voicebot) instead of processing low value interactions with your human agents. Remember ,**the cost and availability of a manual call transfer really expensive and inefficient**. In the Digital Age, AI integration for your PBX makes sense.
