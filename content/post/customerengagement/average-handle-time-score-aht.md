# How does AHT differ from Phone and Video interactions in your Call / Contact Center?
--- 

##	What is a Average Handle Time  Score (AHT)?

When you work in customer support, you know how important it is to optimize your handle times. But while it’s clearly important to reduce average handling time at a Call / Contact Center, it’s not always that simple. Average handle time (AHT) is, as you’ve probably guessed, the average amount of time that a customer call takes from start to finish a process. This includes the time a customer spends with automated greetings, call routing, hold time, and any time an agent spends on tasks post-conversation to resolve the phone call / video call.

##	How does AHT apply to Video CC?

Most of the time, each phone calls duration could be shorter but requires more than one call / transfer to complete any complex customer's support requirement. Video calls require less handle time because Video Agents try to process all customer’s requirements in a single real-time session. No more interactions are required, if the customers has all information needed at the first interaction.

##	Phone vs Video Calls comparison?

If we compare AHT score in the same context services the results are:

> Video (AHT) is lower or equal to Phone (AHT), a single video call interaction handle time is mostly lower than several phone calls required for the same case.
