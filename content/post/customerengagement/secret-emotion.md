According to surveys, [73% of consumers will choose a human over a digital capability when seeking advice or looking to resolve a service issue or complaint.]( http://www.cogitocorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cogito-emotional-experience-index.pdf) Therefore, if a company wants to achieve **the best service and differentiate the customer experience**, should not forget the power of the personal touch in customer service.
