Surveys say [customers highly value great customer experiences.](https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics/) But companies should take into account that **customer expectations are rising.** A shift is taking place. The explosion of digital and technological innovations is having a profound impact on customer empowerment. Therefore, the need for a great customer experience is higher than ever.
 
Many companies are worried when customer satisfaction with contact centers declines.  And they are right. Contact centers are directly responsible for maintaining the company’s image.


###A challenge for contact centers

Rapid changes on customer experience means a challenge to contact centers. They are often looked upon as an expense and find it hard to make a case for better customer support. But it’s important to change. In dealing with empowered customers, companies are forced to adapt, they must be able to personalize experience, anticipating customers’ needs.


###A successful response

A key to success is having a presence on each of the interaction platforms and ensuring a customer experience is consistent across communication platforms (phone, video, chat, social networks). A 360-degree view is fundamental, so new strategies are coherent, from social media to call center.
