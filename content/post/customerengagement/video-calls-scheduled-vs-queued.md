# Why most companies have to change their mind about Video Calls productivity and integration?
--- 

Existing “Video Meeting” solutions are used by most people for teleworking, remote business meeting or friends & family conversations (Zoom, Teams, LifeSize, Google Meet…). All these products are design to build conversations with a scheduled approach one-to-many or one-to-one. Companies that provide support to many customers do not work like this most of the time, they have to react in real-time to a massive inbound and outbound customers requests. For this reason, a Queued approach provide the fastest response time, performance and productivity like in a Contact Center.
