# Escalating Communications: Text, Voice & Video.
---
 
In many websites **it is already possible to access advanced services in real time,** such as chat or video. However, these solutions are often presented as separate and isolated channels. So, if a customer contacts customer service, for example, via chat, he must explain again and again the whole problem over the phone or in the store. To avoid that customers are forced to repeat the processes, it is essential to conceive the new communication channels in real time as **a single escalation process.** Thus, the move from one channel to another takes place naturally.

## Live Chat.

The customer may have contacted the customer service via [Live Chat](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc-live-chat/). It is a simple and comfortable option. Clients can talk to an agent from a laptop or mobile phone. This channel is one of the most popular, since it is very **effective for selling, for exchange accurate data or document links.** But let's imagine that at any given time, the client needs to provide a more detailed explanation of the problem by voice interaction.

## Voice Call.

By pressing the microphone button during Live Chat, **the client can activate [Voice Call](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc-voice-calling/) and continue talking with the same agent he is already chatting with.** The client does not need to explain again what he has already said in the chat. The agent can speak with the client, without having to change his environment. Note that the customer can continue to chat.  Now, let's suppose the agent needs to see the product that needs to be repaired.
 
## Video Call.

Again, the very same web page offers the customer the possibility to press the button of the video camera, **moving easily and naturally to [Video Conference](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc-video-calling/).** The client, who was already chatting or talking to the agent, can now see him to enhance the communication. The video helps to speed up the closing process as the client can live an experience similar to a face-to-face interaction.

##	Swap on interactions on the go!

Escalating can be redifined according to your own procedure to connect with the right interaction at the moment your users or agents need it. This is something that is really a great difference for any business, we understand that you can define properly the way of real-time communication your customers are expecting for each instant.

## In Summary... 

Throughout the entire escalation process, the chat, which was the initial channel, remains active. Therefore, clients and agents can continue to use it, for example, to send documents, links or even share a live screen, during voice call or videoconference.. Because in any of the given steps, **the functions of [capturing images](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc-snapshot/), [sharing documents](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc-file-sharing/), [sharing screens](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc-screen-sharing/) and [cobrowsing](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc-cobrowsing/) are kept available.**
 
Each customer can increase gradualy the communications features, depending on the needs of the business process or conversation modality. Thus, with the [integration of all channels](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/contactcenter/video-integration/) efficiency is improved and maximum benefit is obtained from advanced RTC solutions.
