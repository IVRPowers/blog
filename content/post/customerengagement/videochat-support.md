Video Real-Time Communications [(RTC)](http://localhost:1313/post/technologies/what-is-rtc/) is increasingly becoming a popular support channel. According to report from Gartner, [more than 100 of the 500 largest global businesses](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2956618) will introduce video-based chat by 2018. But bringing online chat to website is not enough. To obtain good results, it should also be implemented correctly.
 
### Humanized Interactions.

Self-service-tools are not always the best option. Customers can feel frustrated trying to reach a live agent or jumping from bot to bot. And a negative customer experience can highly damage your company’s image. Used at the right time, you can delight your clients with a **face-to-face communication**.
 
### Real-Time Communications.

There are situations when empathy, reassurance and knowledge of another human being are needed. And benefits can be huge. Videochat can make a difference on customer experience, as it provides the support of emotional expressions, body language and the **real-time sharing of information**. Videochat empowers your agents and it increases customers’ trust in your brand.
