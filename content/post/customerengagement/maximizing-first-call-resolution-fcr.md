# Consumers rank first-contact resolution as the most valued aspect of a service interaction, yet CX leaders rank it ninth
--- 

In the competitive world of customer service, a key metric or Key Performance Indicator (KPI) stands out: **First Call Resolution (FCR)**. Customers not only expect quick solutions—ideally, speaking with an agent within 1 to 10 minutes—but they also expect to resolve their query in that first interaction. According to a [**Genesys Study**](https://www.genesys.com/company/newsroom/announcements/genesys-research-finds-consumers-believe-ai-will-improve-customer-experience-and-businesses-are-rising-to-the-opportunity), although consumers trust that artificial intelligence and innovative tools will improve their experience, when facing personal situations or complex complaints, they prefer direct attention from a human agent capable of listening, understanding, and resolving situations beyond simple automated responses. This is where [**Transactional video calls**](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/marketing/transactional-video-calls/), which connect Contact Center agents through phone and other channels like WhatsApp or chatbots, become the ideal solution to prioritize FCR and improve customer satisfaction. This is especially valuable when resolving queries that automated text or voice systems cannot handle.

### Why Should FCR be the Number One Priority?

FCR is not just a KPI of operational efficiency; it's also a reflection of how customers perceive the brand. Resolving a problem on first contact reduces frustrations, strengthens loyalty, and decreases operational costs by avoiding repeated interactions. However, achieving high FCR in an environment where queries are increasingly complex is not an easy task. Traditional tools like telephone or chat often fall short, leaving agents and customers in a cycle of frustrated expectations or misunderstandings. The answer lies in a more direct, visual, and human approach: transactional video calls.

### Why Do CX Leaders Tend Not to Prioritize FCR?

Although FCR is regularly measured in processes, customer experience leaders don't give it the priority it deserves. Studies show that companies rank it as the ninth priority in their service strategies—a position that directly contradicts customer expectations revealed in these same studies. This low prioritization has an obvious reason: without adequate tools like video, companies don't achieve significant improvements in case resolution when limited to using only voice and text. Therefore, it's crucial to focus on implementing changes in channels that effectively address customer needs.

### Transactional Video Calls: The Boost FCR Needs

[**Transactional video calls**](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/marketing/transactional-video-calls/) take customer service to another level by enabling face-to-face interactions in real-time, regardless of distance. This visual and dynamic format offers unique advantages for maximizing FCR:

- **✅ Instant Clarity**: Agents can see the customer, understand their context, and address the problem precisely, eliminating assumptions or communication errors.
- **✅ Visual Resolution**: From showing documents to guiding the customer step by step through screen sharing, video calls facilitate complete solutions in a single session.
- **✅ More Human Connection**: The empathy transmitted through visual contact generates trust, making customers feel heard and better served from the first moment.
- **✅ Improved Effectiveness**: Agents cost the same whether they attend in text, voice, or video, however with augmented capabilities they are more resolutive and effective in their responses.

Consider a customer with a technical problem: instead of clumsily describing it over the phone, the agent visualizes the issue on screen, takes screenshots, and resolves it in minutes. That's FCR in action.

### Direct FCR Benefits for Companies

[**Transactional video calls**](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/marketing/transactional-video-calls/) bring significant advantages to improve FCR and your company's operational efficiency. Below, we explore the most outstanding benefits that directly impact your results:

- **✅ Single Interaction Resolutions**: The combination of audio and video minimizes misunderstandings, ensures accurate and empathetic data capture, allowing agents to resolve cases instantly.
- **✅ Times Aligned with Expectations**: With a visual attention approach, interactions should stay within the critical range of direct agent attention of 1 to 10 minutes that customers expect.
- **✅ Higher Customer Satisfaction**: High FCR not only solves problems but generates a positive brand perception, significantly improving service evaluations compared to other channels.
- **✅ Operational Cost Savings**: Reducing repeated contacts decreases workload for teams, saves interaction time, and increases agent satisfaction with their productivity and resolution.

These points cannot be ignored by any company that truly wants to improve their customer service, thus avoiding falling into the trap of doing the same as always or simply copying their competition's methodology. FCR is the key.
