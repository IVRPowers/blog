Video calls are being very well received by users. Minutes dedicated to video calls grow on [social networks](http://mashable.com/2017/05/08/whatsapp-video-calling-stats/#XGHbsY8ay5qb) and more and more companies include this feature. It's just a matter of time before the video becomes a predominant tool in customer services. The video allows to establish communications in **a more natural way, with the human touch of the in-person visits and making communications clearer and more efficient.**

Many businesses have noticed the potential of videoRTC and have integrated it into their customer service strategies. One of the keys is the integration of video in [interactive kiosks](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-kiosk/), which allows to provide the customer immediate support at the point of sale. We have already seen in previous posts how [retail stores, luxury stores and financial institutions](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/customerengagement/businesses-kiosk/) can benefit from this technology. Here we show new businesses that can improve their customer service through the integration of videoRTC in interactive kiosks:


## Drugstores.

Kiosks provide up-to-date and accurate information about the products available, both within the shop and online. Customers can obtain information about products they are looking for or scan them. At the interactive kiosks clients can **watch videos, read review or finalize a purchase.** If customers need additional assistance, RTC technology allows to remotely **contact an expert in real time.**


## Airports.

Interactive kiosks at airports enable the possibility to check aircraft departures and arrival times, keep informed about possible delays, print tickets, change tickets or resolve any doubt by contacting airline representatives in real time. This solution improves efficiency by providing **immediate customer service without waiting in line.**


## Libraries.

At a simple touch of a finger, visitors can access all the **information they need about the facility and the library amenities.** Through interactive kiosks, users can **obtain data on a specific document.** They can also find out if it is available, on which shelf they can locate it or reserve it.
