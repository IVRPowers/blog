[Interactive kiosks](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-kiosk/) are changing consumer experience thanks to WebRTC technology. They allow **immediate connections between advisers and customers, sharing documents and paying for products or services,** among other different applications. Letâ€™s see which businesses can remarkably [improve their customer services](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/customerengagement/key-benefits-kiosk/) through interactive kiosks:
 
 
 
## Retail Stores.
 
Interactive kiosks can critically **enhance efficiency and customer retention** in retail stores. They allow clients to talk to a salesperson immediately in real-time. Customers do not need to look for someone to serve them and wait until some salesperson is available. Customer engagement can also be boosted through loyalty cards that allow to obtain special benefits, such as promotions and sales targeted solely at clients via kiosk. Some examples of stores that can place kiosks and obtain significant benefits are cosmetic shops, sport stores, clothing and shoe shops or drugstores.
 
 
 
## High-cost products stores.
 
Interactive kiosks are an efficient solution in computer shops, car dealerships, furniture stores or phone shops. These stores sell valuable products which require expert assistance. And, therefore, buying one of them very often involves waiting a long time until staff can serve you. Self-service kiosks enable clients to **access information when staff is not available.** They also offer **a wide range of products,** as kiosks give customers the choice to browse products that cannot be displayed in-store because there is not sufficient space.
 
 
 
## Banks and financial institutions.
 
Self-service kiosks are already playing a key role in the bank industry. Some [financial institutions have started to obtain benefits from this disruptive technology]( https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2017/08/credit-unions-tap-video-tech-connect-customers) that allows to make transactions, provide personal loans and interact with an agent in real-time. Clients can obtain a better experience in-branch through interactive kiosks. It is **more convenient for clients and a cost-efficiency solution,** as they reduce waiting lines and allow to set smaller offices, while maintaining in-branch advantages.
