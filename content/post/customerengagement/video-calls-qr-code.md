# Why most companies have to change their mind about Video Calls productivity and integration?
--- 

Most “Video Meeting” solutions (Zoom, Teams, LifeSize, Google Meet…) used for teleworking, remote business meetings, doctor visits or friends & family conversations are based on scheduled invitation for specific users. A scheduled approach can be one-to-many or one-to-one when you are sending an invite to connect. In real-time processes, you will need to manage quickly the following inbound videocall in real-time. Assigned agent could be busy with the previous visit, and another user may pick up the Video Call for the next user. For this reason, a Team View approach provide the fastest response time, performance and productivity thanks to a real-time collaboration.
