--- 

##	What is a Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)?

A big strength of Customer Satisfaction Score (CSTA) is an easy way to close the loop on a customer interaction and determine whether or not it was effective in producing happiness. If for some reason the experience wasn't satisfactory, it's easy to pinpoint that moment and take actions to remedy the experience. Not only that, but you can track customer satisfaction across the customer lifecycle very simply using Customer Satisfaction Score post call and post videocall.

##	How does CSTA apply to Video CC?

Most of the time, phone calls require to make another interaction and send any more information in paper or get presencial assistance to process all customer's requirements. Advanced video calls are designed to be able to process all tasks directly in a single interaction. This specific capacity provides a highest satisfaction to customers despite of any difficulties with their camera or mobile device. Customers always feel much better attended, when they can speak and get assistance face-to-face!

##	Phone vs Video Calls comparison?
