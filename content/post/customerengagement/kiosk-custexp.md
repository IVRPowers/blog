WebRTC is a transformative technology. It means **a shift in the way we think about communications.** [WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/)  makes it possible a real-time engagement by integrating voice, video, data, messaging and more. Applications of WebRTC are endless and they can play a major role in the way businesses operate.


## The in-store customer experience
 
In-store experiences are not always perceived by clients as satisfactory ones. In some businesses, it can even become an obstacle. **Long waiting lines might be a disincentive** to clients as they feel theyâ€™re wasting time. Sales assistant often must pay attention to several requests from clients, and, so, the customer experience can be negatively affected. To solve some of these problems, one of the increasingly growing solutions are kiosks. 


## The end of waiting lines
 
A [kiosk]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_kiosk) is a computer terminal featuring specialized hardware and software that provides access to information and applications. It allows to connect remotely with a real person.
 
Kiosks can be placed throughout the stores or the offices. Therefore, clients can talk to **a salesperson in real-time from the very moment they enter into the store.** Clients receive information through a face-to-face interaction in a **more convenient way and faster.** It also increases **efficiency,** as companies can hire more sale persons remotely. Interactive kiosks for customer support can help to improve **a broad range of businesses,** such as the car industry, mobile phone stores, financial companies or sales retailers.
