# How does CES differ from Phone and Video interactions in your Call / Contact Center?
--- 

##	What is a Customer Effort Score (CES)?

A **Customer Effort Score (CES)** is a service metric that measures how much effort customers put in to interact with your business. These interactions can be something like how much effort it takes to use your product or service or how easy it was for them to have a problem solved by your service reps.

##	How does CES apply to Video CC?

Video CC requires less customer effort through the use of real-time collaborative tools. One of the most detrimental aspects of customer service is the inability to directly resolve or repeat tasks with several calls or agents. Considering that a video call service allows you to perform all tasks at the same time in front of the customer including identification, document capture, photos, live demonstration... your effort with the interaction drops and the CES rises whatever the sector of activity.

##	Phone vs Video Calls comparison?

If we compare CES in the same context services the results are:  

> Video (CES) is lower to Phone (CES), no task repetition, no waste of time, more direct resolution on time with advanced real-time collaboration tools.
