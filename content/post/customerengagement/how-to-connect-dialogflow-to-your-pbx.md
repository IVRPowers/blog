---

Continuing on our quest of better business communications, both old DTMF menus and *speech direct dialog* are outdated IVR options, we can replace them by the power of a [DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.com/) advanced [Conversational AI](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/conversational-ivr-applications/) service.  

##	Prerequisities

###	1- Text-to-Speech API account (TTS)

You can connect any TTS according to your language and voice preferences. It makes sense to use different voices than Google Assistant, itâ€™s really better.

ðŸ’¡Amazon Polly or Azure provides more languages and voices.

###	2- Speech Recognition API account (ASR)

You can connect many engines, like Alexa AWS or Azure Speech Recognition, both are good but Google is faster on DialogFlow integration using direct STT processing.

ðŸ’¡Use Google Speech Recognition to speed up your service with DialogFlow direct speech processing.

###	3- Google DialogFlow account and agent (NLU)

DialogFlow is the dialog manager, it will manage all rules, itents and will use AI Machine Learning to improve the conversation itself.

ðŸ’¡Activate Professional for more thanâ€¦

###	4- Smart IVR subscription account (IVR)

Nothing can work without this, itâ€™s the core engine of the speech integration, the IVR server connects: NLU, TTS, ASR, PBX to get running the whole solution.

ðŸ’¡CPaaS IVR Plus features are required to create advanced phone services with DialogFlow.

###	5- Voicebot Framework (APP)

We provide a Conversational App. Framework to manage a Dialogflow Agent interaction. 

ðŸ’¡You may start from scratchâ€¦ the dialog is so easy!

###	6- Your PBX or IP Operator (SIP Trunking, DDI Numbering)

Configure a SIP trunk between the IVR server and your PBX or operator.

ðŸ’¡Itâ€™s your own PBX, the main condition is to be SIP compliant.
