# Why most companies have to change their mind about Video Calls productivity and integration?
--- 

Most “Video Meeting” solutions (Zoom, Teams, LifeSize, Google Meet…) used for teleworking, remote business meetings, doctor visits or friends & family conversations are based on scheduled invitation for specific users. A scheduled approach can be one-to-many or one-to-one when you are sending an invite to connect. In real-time processes, you will need to manage quickly the following inbound videocall in real-time. Assigned agent could be busy with the previous visit, and another user may pick up the Video Call for the next user. For this reason, a Team View approach provide the fastest response time, performance and productivity thanks to a real-time collaboration.

These are some key reasons:

##	1. Collaborative Video Calling.

In a virtual shared waiting room, agents can be attended faster by another agent.

##	2. Timeline Priorization.

You can check waiting time of each user and change priority to attend all of them.

##	3. Toggle to Collaboration.

You can manage your own visits only or check the waiting room to get the next user to be attended.

##	4. One-click User Connection.

Users can reconnect anytime with the same active session to get connect with another agent.
