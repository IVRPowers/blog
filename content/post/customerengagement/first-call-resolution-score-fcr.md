# How does FCR differ from Phone and Video interactions in your Call / Contact Center?
--- 

##	What is a First Call Resolution Score (FCR)?

The **First Call Resolution (FCR)** can come in handy as one of many important metrics to keep track of in the pursuit of exceptional customer service. Furthermore, FCR measures a company's ability to resolve phone calls, chats, emails, video calls, and website customer interactions resolved on the first contact. Originally, the FCR rate was measured only on phone calls but has expanded to all contact channels in a Call / Contact Center.

##	How does FCR apply to Video CC?

FCR score is obviously better with a video call than a phone call in customer support, it's not a question of speed or agent performance, it's a question of ability and availability of real-time collaboration tools. Phone calls cannot compite in a single call resolution against an advanced video channel; this experience is closer to a presencial service thanks to its extended tools that enable to solve most questions or situations remotely.

##	Phone vs Video Calls comparison?

If we compare FCR score in the same context services the results are:

> Video (FCR) is higher or equal to Phone (FCR), much more capacity to answer all customer requirements in a face-to-face real-time communication with collaboration tools.
