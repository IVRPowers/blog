Training is the most important thing to consider to make your [Voicebot IVR](https://www.ivrpowers.com/portfolio/voicebot/) smart enough when it goes in production. Many projects forgot to review continuously learning rules, intents and transactions logs.

When a **Voicebot or conversational agent does not understand you, it is because, in reality, he does not have been properly trained**. When a request is new in the sense that he cannot associate an intent with the formulation. Quite simply, the voicebot was not trained properly on this verbatim because the request may be:

* A new intent that the project had not yet coded!
* A new sentence for an existing pattern

Letâ€™s add a **bot trainer (professional services)** to ensures that the conversational agent takes into account new requests (provided they are frequent and representative), its language is enriched and so are its missions! A Voicebot whose only mission at the beginning was to track parcels can, after some time, take care of complaints as well.

To ensure the best **customer experience (CX)**, the most important thing is to think and train any interaction, without neglecting the means to maintain all **Natural Language Understanding** ([NLU](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-nlu/)) transactions logs. This requires a good expert human support. Natively running as **Communication Platform as a Service** ([CPaaS](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-cpaas/)) or ([SaaS](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-saas/)), your voicebot will provide the personalized service you have imagined for your customers on the channels they prefer (website, mobile application, phone, Google or Alexa speakers, etc.).
