# How does NPS differ from Phone and Video interactions in your Call / Contact Center?
--- 

##	What is a Net Promoter Score (NPS)?

The **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** is an index ranging from -100 to 100 that measures the willingness of customers to recommend a company's products or services to others. It is used as a proxy for gauging the customer's overall satisfaction with a company's product or service and the customer's loyalty to the brand. The primary objective of the net promoter score methodology is to infer customer loyalty (as evidenced by repurchase and referral).

##	How does NPS apply to Video CC?

Customers are more likely to recommend a video call than a phone call when they can select to access a service like this. Recommending just a phone service is a commodity, even if it's a very good one many other brands or services have one too. The customer is much more impacted when the attention has been face to face, personalized, using collaborative sharing tools and a complete resolution. Adding a video customer service raises the value of your interactions and the NPS promotion.

##	Phone vs Video Calls comparison?

If we compare NPS in the same context services the results are:  

> Video (NPS) is higher or equal to Phone (NPS), more innovation, more emotion, more resolution ability and getting a better CX experience with the agent.
