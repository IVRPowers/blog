# Conversational IVR applications to improve your customer experience in phone services.
---

Tradicional [IVR](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-ivr/) systems have been built as limited DTMF and direct IVR dialogs for a long time. Yet it is not a secret that the experience using those solutions has is rather poor. In 70% of those interactions, the end users end up frustrated; at “best” case scenario are rerouted to a human agent. In the less fortunate cases, they will just hang up.

> 70% of existing DTMF or Direct Dialog are frustrating phone callers

Today, **Conversational IVR applications** are offering a very different form of smart speech interaction, that allows the user to freely talk when they interact with a machine. **The customer no longer needs to adapt himself to the machine**, by clicking digits or repeating certain words — No — now the customer talks and the machine will do whatever it takes to understand the request and provide with a precise and accurate reply.

> Conversational IVR dramatically improves customer experience (CX)

A **Conversational IVR application** uses AI (deep-learning) backend services to increase the accuracy of the automatic responses and therefore improves the **conversation’s success rate by more than a 100%**. This is translated into 30%-60% decrease in agent-based calls (you can figure out the costs implications);

[Smart IVR](https://www.ivrpowers.com/voicexml/) platforms are designed to deploy an advanced dialog experience with an affordable cost and running most of existing [Cloud Speech API](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/trends/cloud-api-trend/) and [Natural Language Understanding (NLU)](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-nlu/) developments. 

In summary:

* Carrier grade, scalable, load balancing…
* Open standard based on W3C VoiceXML
* Full cloud deployment for multiple services
* SIP Connect integration ready
* Cloud Speech API for TTS and ASR
* Easy integration for NLU and Chat bot engines
