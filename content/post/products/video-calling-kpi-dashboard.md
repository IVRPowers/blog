We are excited to announce the latest update to our **Web ACD** 1.21 platform, which introduces a cutting-edge **KPI Dashboard**. This significant enhancement represents a major leap forward in our system's capabilities and promises to improve the user experience for our clients.

The newly implemented **KPI Dashboard** offers a comprehensive and intuitive view of critical productivity metrics, meticulously designed to cater to the needs of both Supervisors and Agents.

With this new feature, users can effortlessly monitor real-time performance metrics, track historical trends, and make data-driven decisions to optimize their workflow. The **KPI Dashboard** not only streamlines the process of performance evaluation but also fosters a culture of continuous improvement within organizations.
