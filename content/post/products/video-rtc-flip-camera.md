# Switching all cameras during any video call for your services on Video RTC

We are pleased to announce a new feature called **Flip Camera** ready for all Video RTC widgets that enables switch to next available camera inside your device. In case you’re using a smartphone or tablet, this feature switch from front to back camera. In desktop web browsers, this feature will change to the next camera until you make a complete loop. All this switching is executed in hot mode during a videocall without any video streaming interruption.
