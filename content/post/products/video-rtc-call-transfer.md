# Video RTC enables to transfer any video call by simply dialing the extension of a queue or agent.
---

**Video Call Transferring**, or **Video Call forwarding**, is a process of relocating an inbound video call to another agent. Video Call Transfer is very useful for video agents and internally for contact center teams. Video agents use call transferring to instantly route incoming calls throughout the Contact Center or Organization. CC Teams use video call transferring to pass video callers along to a different video agent or extension or external number service, whether it's a call with a customer, queue or a video call with another colleague.

## Video Call Transferring Procedure.

Let’s describe the any process of video call transfer on Video RTC is powered both by SIP and Web RTC.

1. **Press Pause**, to keep the video call connected.
2. **Dial to Extension**, to speak with a colleague and check information.
3. **Press Transfer**, to transfer the video call.
