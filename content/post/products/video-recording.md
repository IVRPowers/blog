###	Step 1. Streams recording

A Videocall is initiated by a user or agent into the Video Gateway.  This session will be composed of for media streams (agent-video, agent-audio, user-video, user-video) blended together in a single interaction with an info file.

###	Step 2. S3 Bucket archiving

The Video Gateway converts each stream to a regular RAW files that can be transferred by a recording server to an external storage area over S3 buckets. Along with the videocall index file, a unique session ID generated by the Video Gateway (WebRTC) is linked too. The process start once the call hangout event is activated, a job is in charge to ensure all streams are properly ZIP / tar.gz archived once completed.

###	Step 3. MP4 / RAW on demand access

All Video Stream in RAW can only be played by the Video Gateway convertor or dual-player. To get a unique file in MP4 (video & audio) or MP3 (audio) you can ask the Video Recording Service to generate it from the S3 bucket. This format can played on most existing video players and is easier to manage and store in an external system if required. The MP4 file includes both the agent and the user video mixed.

###	Step 4. SSH / FTP batch exportation

Most quality insurance process in a Contact Center can require to play, access and export in MP4 / MP3 a specific conversation, the video recording service allow to make a batch exportation using an SSH or FTP from the S3 bucket.

###	Step 5. API content access
