##	How does it work?

All [Video Gateways](https://www.ivrpowers.com/videortc/) (WebRTC) developed by Interactive Powers include a special [SPLIT](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-split/) module which allows separate the media streams (video - audio - data) for any communication between users and agents. This development is based on SIP  and [WebRTC](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/) peers communications for the integration of voice, video and data in Contact Centers.

![Video Recording Process](/postimages/products/ivrpowers-turnkey-screen.016.png)

###	Step 1. Streams recording

A Videocall is initiated by a user or agent into the Video Gateway.  This session will be composed of four media streams (agent-video, agent-audio, user-video, user-video) blended together in a single compressed RAW file.

###	Step 2. S3 Bucket archiving

The Video Gateway converts each stream to a regular RAW files that can be transferred by a recording server to an external storage area over S3 buckets. Along with the videocall index file, a unique session ID generated by the Video Gateway (WebRTC) is linked too. The process start once the call hangout event is activated, a job is in charge to ensure all streams are properly ZIP / tar.gz archived once completed.

###	Step 3. MP4 / RAW on demand access

All Video Stream in RAW can only be played by the Video Gateway convertor or dual-player. To get a unique file in MP4 (video & audio) you can ask the Video Recording Service to generate it. The MP4 format can played on most existing video players and is easier to manage; it includes both the agent and the user video mixed.

###	Step 4. SSH / FTP batch exportation

Most quality insurance process in a Contact Center can require to play, access and export in MP4 / MP3 a list of video calls / conversations, the video recording service enables to make a batch exportation using an SSH or FTP from the S3 bucket.

###	Step 5. API content access

Customers can have access to manage their own contents in order to get RAW or MP4 files recorded for external usages or other systems. Each service has an account and all functions are running over AWS / API and secure S3 tools.
