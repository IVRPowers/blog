We are pleased to unveil some key elements of our [Video RTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc/) (WebRTC) evolution until 2017.  Major changes will follow [WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/)â€™s evolution itself. Our primary goal is to provide improved features to all [Special Extensions](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc-special-extensions/) like SPLIT, Video Calling, Live Chat, File Sharing, Screen Sharing, Video Recording, Snapshot...  In the next quarter, we will make significant improvements like adding a better Customer Experience with Video Real-Time Communications...

All of this, will be also included into our [API Framework](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/development/introducing-videortcjs-developers/)!
