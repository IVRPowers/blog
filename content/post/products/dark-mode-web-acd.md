# Stay tuned for a sleek New Look, enhance your agents video calling experience
---

We're excited to announce the launch of **Dark Mode**, a highly recommended feature that offers a sleek new look for our Web ACD platforms. Designed to improve your agents productivity and confort, **Dark Mode** offers a better video calling experience that is easy on the eyes and perfect for low-light working environments.

Hereâ€™s why they will love it:

## 1. Reduces Eye Strain
**Comfortable Viewing**: Dark Mode reduces the brightness of the screen, helping to minimize eye strain, especially during extended video calls or long working hours in low-light conditions for your agents.

## 2. Saves Battery Life

**Efficient Power Usage**: On devices with OLED screens, Dark Mode can significantly reduce battery consumption on Laptops or Tablets PC. Dark pixels consume less power, meaning you can use our Web ACD longer without worrying about battery drain.

## 3. Enhances Visual Appeal

**Sleek Aesthetics**: The dark theme offers a modern, sophisticated look that enhances the visual appeal of Web ACD, providing a fresh and professional interface for your video contact center.

## 4 Improves Readability

**Less Glare**: The darker background with light text reduces glare, making it easier to read content. This is particularly beneficial for agents who read a lot on their devices and have intensive support direct video tasks.

## 5. Reduces Blue Light Exposure

**Health Benefits**: Dark Mode reduces exposure to blue light, which can disrupt your sleep patterns. Using Dark Mode in the evening can help you wind down and get a better night's sleep for remote workers.

## 6. Customizable Experience

**Personal User Preference**: Whether you prefer a light or dark theme, Web ACD now offers you the option to choose. Tailor your video contact center experience to fit your personal preferences and work environment.

## 7. Focus on Content

**Minimal Distractions**: Dark Mode helps minimize distractions by focusing your attention on the content rather than the interface. This is especially useful during critical video interactions that require your full concentration.

# How to Enable Dark Mode?

Activating **Dark Mode** is very simple. Go to your app settings or icon bar, select the display options, and switch to Dark Mode. Enjoy a new, visually comfortable experience with just a few taps.
