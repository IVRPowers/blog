## Four Steps Testing… 

### Step 1. Check the Web Browser.

A web browser can be desktop or mobile, it’s the main application required to initiate properly a RTC session. This step will detect and check if your web browser version is WebRTC compliant to enable Video Real-Time communications.

### Step 2. Check the Microphone & Speaker.

Our second step is to check if you have audio devices (microphone, speakers) to enable a voice call. This is a minimum requirement to ensure your WebRTC session is capable to audio-connect peers and enable to speak each other.

### Step 3. Check the Video Camera.

Our third step is to check if you have a web cam to have video call. This step is tested separately because video is not always required for a WebRTC communications, so you can select if this step only if it's required for your service.

### Step 4. Check the Internet Bandwidth & Speed.

Our fourth and last step is to check the bandwidth sending and receiving a set of TCP/UDP packages that will allow our tester to check how fast and stable is the Internet access right now for your user. This step is very important for your QoS.
