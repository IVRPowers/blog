## Overview

**Over Printing** feature allows to print a logo inside the remote frame. Instead of specific customisation you can use it to distribute video calls to several services with their own service logo. It’s very useful for a Call Center with many services operated with different profiles.

**Over Printing** functionality is easy to configure inside our multi-flavor settings without specific coding. You can assign a specific position and logo to each service or flavor of your platform in order to over print it during all video calls sessions.

## Use Cases

* Enable to over print a logo during your video calls
* Enable create a multi-service configuration without coding
* Power multi-services for Contact Center
