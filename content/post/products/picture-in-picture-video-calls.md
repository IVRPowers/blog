#	Maximizing Agent Productivity with “Picture-in-Picture” during Video Calls.
---

**Picture-in-picture (PiP)** is a useful feature for contact center agents who need to multitask during transactional video calls. With PiP, agents can continue to have a conversation with their customers while also keeping an eye on other important information or tasks that require their attention.

Some features that can make PiP even more useful for agents include the ability to resize and reposition the PiP window, the option to customize which part of the screen is shown in the PiP window, and the ability to mute or pause the PiP video while still keeping it visible on the screen. Additionally, a feature that allows agents to take notes within the PiP window or to easily access other applications while in PiP mode can further enhance productivity during video calls.

Overall, the PiP function can greatly benefit agents by allowing them to multitask and maintain their focus on both the customer and other important tasks, ultimately leading to more efficient and productive interactions.
