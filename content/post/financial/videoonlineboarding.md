**Video Online Onboarding** allows anyone to open an account or become customer in just a few minutes and start banking, getting a service or insurance contract right away. This new approach uses an innovative procedure that verifies a customerâ€™s identity through a selfie and a video call. Video Online Onboarding is combining Video ID to verify the authenticity of identity documents with facial recognition and Video RTC to have a face-to-face video call with an agent to approve the process. Video Online Onboarding is both secure and user friendly for the web and mobile, since users prefer mobile, and smartphones have camera.

**Video Online Process in 3 steps:**

**Step 1. ID Verification**

Take a picture of the ID document. The iCAR Vision will determine the authenticity of the identity document.

**Step 2. Selfie Verification**

Take a selfie to compare the ID picture with the image in front of the camera. The iCAR Vision API will check that the pictures match. 

**Step 3. Live Video Call** 

Make a live video call with an agent to approve the whole process and verify that all data and your person are properly matched.

In conclusion, make a Video Online Onboarding will allow to online agreement signature, open bank account or get a new insurance contracts. We will have the possibility to make all these procedures without moving out from our home or work.
