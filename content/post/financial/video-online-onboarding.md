**Video Online Onboarding** allows anyone to open an account or become customer in just a few minutes and start banking, getting a service or insurance contract right away. This new approach uses an innovative procedure that verifies a customerâ€™s identity through a selfie and a video call. Video Online Onboarding is combining Video ID to verify the authenticity of identity documents with facial recognition and Video RTC to have a video call with an agent to approve the process. Video Online Onboarding is both secure and user friendly for the web and mobile, since users prefer mobile and smartphones with a camera.

Video Online Onboarding Process in 3 steps:

## Step 1. ID Verification
Take a picture of the ID document. The iCAR Vision will determine the authenticity of the identity document.

## Step 2. Selfie Verification

## Step 3. Live Video Call
Make a live video call with an agent to approve the whole process and verify that all data and your person are properly matched.
