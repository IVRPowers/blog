Since 2015, Interactive Powers (IVRPowers) has been diligently refining its Video RTC solutions, API Framework and SDKs to make embedded video much more accessible for developers and enterprises who are looking to rapidly integrate reliable video chat into their own applications.

Today, we’re thrilled to officially announce a new **VideoRTC.js** library – the launch of our self-service API Framework developer tools, which lets developers quickly and easily embed this same enterprise-grade, cloud-hosted, multiparty RTC video collaboration into any web, mobile or native application on virtually any device.

Whether you are developing for smartphones, or the latest connected hardware such as smart glasses or drones, we believe that enterprise-grade embedded video should be simple. IVRPowers provides SDKs for iOS, Android and web browsers (WebRTC and plugin), with a consistent **API Framework** that speeds time to market and lowers costs.

VideoRTC.js is available now – it’s fast and easy to get started – new users receive free support, and there is no credit card required for initial sign-up, creating a no-risk development environment.
