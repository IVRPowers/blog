Since 2015, Interactive Powers has been diligently refining its [Video RTC](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc/) solutions, **API Framework** and **SDKs** to make embedded video much more accessible for developers and enterprises who are looking to rapidly integrate reliable video chat into their own applications.

## VideoRTC.js library

Today, we’re thrilled to officially announce a new **VideoRTC.js** library – the launch of our self-service API Framework developer tools, which lets developers quickly and easily embed this same enterprise-grade, cloud-hosted, multiparty [RTC](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-rtc/) video collaboration into any web, mobile or native application on virtually any device.

## Android & iOS SDKs

Whether you are developing for smartphones, or the latest connected hardware such as smart glasses or drones, we believe that enterprise-grade embedded video should be simple. We provides SDKs for iOS, Android and web browsers ([WebRTC](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/) and plugin), with a consistent **API Framework** that speeds time to market and lowers costs.
