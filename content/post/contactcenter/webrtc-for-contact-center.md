**The way people access customer service is changing**. If existing they want to survive in a highly competitive digital market, [Contact Centers must adapt properly their services](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/contactcenter/contact-centers-digital-transformation/) and make a continuious effort to provide greater customer experiences.
 
##	Poor Customer Services Practices
 
Today, **Contact Centers cannot always provide the best customer service only over the phone channel**. Clients who call in for specific support are usually kept on hold for long periods of time – considering that call centers numbers are not always included in phone price plans – they have to repeat information or if they write an email or if they interact on a web content **they never receive an answer in real-time**. Consumers complain because of these practices and, in fact, [bad customer experiences have a very negative impact on businesses](https://www.helpscout.net/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics/). A YouGov UK survey revealed that [76% of adults would switch providers after just one unpleasant contact center experience](http://pressreleases.responsesource.com/news/51358/as-latest-yougov-surveys-show-a-good-contact-centre-experience/#.VL6YPi7F_ng).

##	Immediate Assistance trough a Web Browser
