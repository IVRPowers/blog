#  Interoperability becomes the key requirement: a seamless video transfer integration between all software contact center solutions.
---

Contact centers, like the rest of the communications industry, are experiencing a rapidly changing landscape. These changes in technology are spurring changes in human behaviors and customer expectations. The post-COVID19 situation is making the **Customer Experience (CX) a key factor in the consumer decision-making process**.

It’s no longer a world of call centers, **today’s contact center has to be prepared to handle omnichannel communications: video calls, calls, emails, online chat, and text messages**. Communications platforms are rapidly shifting from on-premise, to cloud or a hybrid of the two. Maintaining technology compliance to meet local and international connection in the face of this change is a huge challenge.

## Video RTC is transforming Contact Centers in 2020.

The choice for an all-in-one contact center solution might appear simple, but it has a serious downside, namely, one-size does NOT fit all. Choosing a best-in-breed strategy of picking the modular components best suited for an individual contact center’s needs allows for a high degree of customization, can increase efficiency, and provide a faster return on investment (ROI). But, **a best-in-breed strategy requires finding systems that can be easily integrated with Video Channels each others like Phone Channels does**.
