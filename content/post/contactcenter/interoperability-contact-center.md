#  Whatever your contact center is, we can make it interoperable with  videocalls and advanced online interactions.

Many companies fear that the integration of video in their contact centers will involve a large [investment of human and economic resources.](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/contactcenter/video-integration/) Because companies think they will be forced to change the entire contact center solution, they may ignore video integration and, therefore, **the opportunity to significantly improve their services and customer experience.**

However, the existing contact centers should not be an obstacle. Solutions provided by [Interactive Powers](http://www.ivrpowers.com/) are **fully interoperable with existing VoIP / PSTN structures.** The contact center is maintained and the potential to interact with [VideoRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc/) is just added. Whatever your contact center is, we can make it interoperable with  videocalls and advanced online interactions.

Jumping into advanced interactions is that simple!
