Many companies fear that the integration of video in their contact centers will involve a large [investment of human and economic resources.](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/contactcenter/video-integration/) Because companies think they will be forced to change the entire contact center solution, they are ignoring video integration and, therefore, **the opportunity to significantly improve their services.**


However, the existing contact centers should not be an obstacle. Solutions provided by [Interactive Powers](http://www.ivrpowers.com/) are **fully interoperable with existing structures.** The contact center is maintained and the potential to interact with VideoRTC is just added. Whatever your contact center is, we can make it interoperable with video. Jumping into advanced interactions is that simple!
