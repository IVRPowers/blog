# Video calls demand operational excellence in communications technology to deliver professional services that match the high performance of traditional voice channels.
---

Video communication is the most demanding channel in terms of quality and performance, requiring robust and optimized infrastructure to manage video calls with the same efficiency as phone calls. To ensure a smooth and professional experience comparable to voice, the highest operational standards are required. The [SPLIT](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/split-6-x-update/) communication protocol is specifically designed to deliver transactional video calls that meet the most rigorous market demands, providing:

1. ✅ Intelligent **Distribution** through advanced Contact Center ACD routing.
2. ✅ Multiple Video Call **Modes** (inbound, outbound, scheduled, escalated, reversed, during calls...)
3. ✅ Adjustable **Video Quality** UHD, HD/SD, LD and bandwidth auto-adaptive.
4. ✅ **Interoperability** with SIP protocol and voice telephony services.
5. ✅ Direct and consultative video call **Transfers** between agents or services.
6. ✅ Advanced agent **Supervision Tasks** including Call Whispering.
7. ✅ **Video Recording** with two-tier archiving and advanced post-processing for export.
8. ✅ Complete and mobile **Web Collaboration** (Dual Screen Sharing, Chat, Files, Co-Browsing...)
9. ✅ **Metadata Management** through Security Tokens within the channel and transferable to SIP.
10. ✅ Configurable **Web Responsive** interfaces and URLs with **Custom Domain**.
11. ✅ End-to-end **AES 256-bit Encryption** between participants.
12. ✅ Enterprise-grade **Privacy** and **Security** for each sector (HIPAA, GDPR).
13. ✅ Global **CPaaS** availability with separate nodes by **Regions EU, US...**

Other solutions available in the market generally operate differently from SPLIT, with features and limitations worth considering. Here's how these alternatives typically work:

1. ⚠️ **Digital Assignment** through pop-up notification and agent acceptance.
2. ❌ Only one or two modes available for assignment or scheduling.
3. ⚠️ Generally, HD or SD auto-adaptive quality not adjustable through configuration.
4. ❌ No **Interoperability** with SIP protocol or telephony services.
5. ❌ No direct and consultative **Transfers** between agents or services.
6. ❌ No video call **Supervision Tasks** or Call Whispering.
7. ⚠️ **Video Recording** limited to file storage in repositories.
8. ⚠️ **Web Collaboration** generally without co-browsing or limited to desktop browsers.
9. ❌ External **Metadata Management** to video communication.
10. ⚠️ Predefined Web or App interfaces without customization options.
11. ✅ End-to-end **Encryption** between participants.
12. ⚠️ Enterprise **Privacy** and **Security** not always applicable to Finance or Healthcare.
13. ⚠️ Limited Regional availability through **SaaS** services.

If you haven't asked your Contact Center provider about all this yet, you probably haven't really tried [transactional video calls](https://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/marketing/transactional-video-calls/), but rather a video service experience that's inferior in speed, capacity, and performance. 

Discover the difference [Video RTC](https://interactivepowers.com/en/platforms/videortc) can make in your operation with all these capabilities integrated and optimized for a first-class enterprise service!
