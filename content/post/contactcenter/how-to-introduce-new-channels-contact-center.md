Last years, we have implemented several New Channels projects based on [Video RTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc/) to existing Contact Centers. At times, it was the result of Innovation, but most often it was to enhance the Customer Experience and your services according to a new Market demand. After all, any Contact Center should interact with the customer anywhere they are! **Phone, Email, and Chat are making way for emerging channels such as **Social media, Video, Text, Mobile apps and [IVR](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-ivr/) self services**. Don't worry; this is a very exciting time for the service industry. We are seeing innovative strategies and solutions that are taking the customer service to the ‘Next Level.’

#	Match Customers Needs

While you may have a desire to implement new channels, it must determine if there is a need. Are customers using new channels in their communication? Does internal and external research and data analysis suggest this feature provide a specific value added to your Business? **Do you have the overall volume to support additional channels?** Also, with each new channel, you must ensure your team is properly trained and staffed.

# Make a Pilot Project

Once you are ready to move forward with implementing the new channel, make a Pilot Project with a subset of your team. This will ensure you have better control of the entire process and can make changes on the fly with limited impact on business and customers. **Piloting a program increases your ability to successfully manage it**. Not to mention, it allows those involved to gain more insight and experience while fostering collaboration and communication.

# Evaluate with your Business

Throughout the Pilot, there should be continual evaluation to ensure milestones are being met, scope is defined, and the goal is obtainable in your Business Process. This phase is where a new course can be taken, and objectives can be reassessed. **An evaluation phase determines if the pilot can be applied at a larger scale** or if the project should be scrapped. Therefore, it should be given considerable thought, critique, and discussion.

# Roll out and Go live...

Once the pilot has proven successful, it’s time to implement it. Introduce a new group as the subsequent one is trained and their performance has been evaluated. **Training new staff, and allowing them time to acclimate should be in the forefront of your mind**. This will limit issues from being widespread and lessen the chance the customer is a victim of those mistakes.
