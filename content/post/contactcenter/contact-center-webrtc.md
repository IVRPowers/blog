The ever-growing digital world can give the solution for contact centers to provide a superior customer experience. Nowadays new technologies drive clients to ask for multiple options when looking for support. It is here where [WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/) can help contact centers to enhance their services.
 
### Save time providing the right help
 
Thanks to WebRTC technology you can directly put customers in touch with the agent they need. Depending on the section of the website, the customer is connected to a specific call group. In other words, WebRTC is **the bridge between the clients and the experts.**
 
### Happier clients and happier agents
 
Customers are more satisfied because **they do not have to waste time**, first, looking for a contact number, then, trying to find the right person, and, finally, repeating again and again the reason to contact the company. It has an impact on agents as well, who are **more empowered and efficient.** A happier atmosphere among support teams is crucial to improve company’s image.

### An integrated structure
 
Structure of traditional call centers also changes as a consequence of new clients’ demands. Functions of contact centers have shifted, they do not just receive and handle inbound calls, but many communication methods, data and applications are combined. However, [WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/marketing/webrtc-system-benefits/ ) makes it possible to manage all new aspects through **a centralized interface.** It connects the gaps between the different channels, simplifies upgrades and reduces costs.
 
 
Customer support and contact centers will never disappear, but [WebRTC technology can make the difference.](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/trends/time-add-webcall-button-contact-center/) It helps companies easily adapt to new trends and demands and makes it possible **to provide remarkable customer experiences.** If you need more information about Real-Time Communications solutions, contact us at http://www.ivrpowers.com
