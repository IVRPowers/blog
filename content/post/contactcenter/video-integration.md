Video is **not a separate solution** from the services that contact centers have been providing until now and it is not a substitute for voice calls. The key to the video lies in the possibility of offering a new channel, whose use is progressively increasing.
 
## Wrongdoings in the contact center
 
One of the mistakes some businesses have made is creating disaggregated processes. The result is that agents have to attend one queue or they are forced to change the environment, depending on whether they answer a phone call or a video call. The consequence is a duplicated call flow process with higher costs and lower productivity. However, **the potential of our Video RTC solutions relies precisely into all channels integration phone and WebRTC.**
 
## Omnichannel model is the key for success
 
Inclusion of video significantly increases the quality of the interactions. But the success of a video solution is that **it must be integrated into the contact center** as one more channel of assistance. In other words, it is necessary to achieve an authentic omnichannel model. This way, the agents themselves can handle phone and video calls in a simple and natural way. The advantages are numerous, operational costs are lower and human resources efficiency is multiplied, while allowing existing workflows with backend systems to be maintained.
