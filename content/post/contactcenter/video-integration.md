Video is not a separate solution from the services that contact centers have been providing until now and it is not a substitute for calls. The key to the video lies in the possibility of offering a new channel, whose use is progressively increasing.
 
## Wrongdoings in the contact center.
 
One of the mistakes some businesses have made is creating disaggregated processes. As a result, different agents take care of each type of call or they are forced to change the environment, depending on whether they answer a phone call or a video call. The consequences are duplicated processes, high costs and low efficiency. However, **the potential of new solutions lies precisely in integration.**
 
 
## Omnichannel model is the key for success.
 
Inclusion of video significantly increases the quality of the interactions. But the success of a video solution is that **it must be integrated into the contact center** as one more channel of assistance. In other words, it is necessary to achieve an authentic omnichannel model. This way, the agents themselves can handle phone and video calls in a simple and natural way. The advantages are numerous, since the cost is much lower and the efficiency of both systems and human resources is multiplied, while allowing the usual workflow to be maintained.
