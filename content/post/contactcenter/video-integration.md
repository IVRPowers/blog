#	The Video Channel is the next level Customer Experience frontier for existing Contact Centers
---

Video is **not a separate solution** from the services that contact centers have been providing until now and it is not a substitute for voice calls. The key to the Video in [Real-time communications](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-rtc/) lies in the possibility of offering a new channel, whose use is progressively increasing in customer care services for most [industries](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc-industries/).
 
## Wrongdoings in the Contact Center.
 
One of the mistakes some businesses have made is creating disaggregated processes. **The result is that agents have to attend one queue or they are forced to change the environment, depending on whether they answer a phone call or a video call**. The consequence is a duplicated call flow process with higher costs and lower productivity. However, the potential of our [Video RTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc/) solutions relies precisely into all channels integration phone and [WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/).
 
## Omnichannel model is the Key for Success.
 
Inclusion of video significantly increases the quality of the interactions. But the success of a video solution is that it must be integrated into the contact center as one more channel of assistance. In other words, it is necessary to achieve **an authentic omnichannel model**. This way, the agents themselves can handle phone and video calls in a simple and natural way. **The advantages are numerous, operational costs are lower and human resources efficiency is multiplied**, while allowing existing workflows with any backend systems keep maintained.
