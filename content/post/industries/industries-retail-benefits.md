## 41% of consumers state that a great customer experience, including convenience, is decisive in their loyalty to a brand
---

## Immediate assistance.

One of the most valued elements for customers is having **assistance when they need it.** Real-time communications allow to significantly improve customer service, by offering an instant assistance. Clients no longer need to travel to the store, as they can interact with an agent in person, immediately and through different channels.

## Easy integration.

At Interactive Powers, we take into account the needs of companies and the difficulties involved in a technological transformation. For this reason, we develop solutions that can be **easily integrated in previous platforms,** taking advantage of existing systems and investments made.


## Keep in touch.

On the one hand, the new channels allow you **to maintain contact with customers in a more natural and less invasive way.** On the other, the possibility of **showing personalized offers** allows customers to focus their attention on the products they are really interested in. Such a relation between client and company reinforces customer retention and loyalty.
