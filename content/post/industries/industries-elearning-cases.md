## Video-based learning.
Video use is increasing and video features are critical in e-learning. Video allows students to access lectures, but also share content with their peers and professors, as well as tutoring in live real time interactions.

## Mobile Learning.
Mobile devices are growing in popularity. Depending on their location or needs, learners switch from one device to another. Mobile apps for learning provide the flexibility that users demand.

## Tutoring.
One of the most important elements of learning is the guide of a tutor. Thanks to video and voice tools, tutors receive data of students’ improvement in detail and can provide a personalized supervision.
