##	Omnichannel experience.

Omnichanneling opens the opportunity for call centers to take a significant step in improving customer services and surpassing clients’ growing expectations. It is one of the key for businesses to implement an integral strategy. Clients perceive the advantages as they can engage when needed and through **the most convenient channel: chat, phone call, self-service or video.** At the same time, an omnichannel model allows companies to reach more clients in a more cost-efficient way.


##	More efficient support.

Agents can solve customers’ questions and problems in **the most suitable and efficient way.** While audio and video channels offer a personal touch, chats provide a seamless and quick solution to answer simple questions. Agents can share documents, links and video files and they can see what the client is seeing in the screen and even help them remotely.

 
##	Reinforce brand loyalty.

VideoRTC makes interactions easier, quicker and more comfortable, which **brings customers and companies closer.** It considerably adds value, improving customer experience. New voice and video channels help to retain existing customers, they are more willing to return, as satisfaction with services are boosted and, therefore, brand trust. But a better service also **increases recommendations and makes companies more attractive to new clients.**
