#	38% of in person visits to their physician could have been replaced with Telemedicine
---

##	Improved Workflows and Processes.

Patients can contact their doctor directly via mobile phone or tablet. In this way, it is their usual doctor who decides if the patient needs to go to the medical center to receive care. In cases of urgent care, their doctor guides the patient through teleconference until the arrival of a health team.
 
##	Cost Reduction.

Telehealth can significantly reduce medical costs. Reimbursement of telemedicine services is growing as implementation is expanding. While increasing the quality of medical care, telehealth remarkably decrease readmission rates and in person visits. The price of telemedicine interventions is also reduced and, therefore, it is more attractive to consumers.
 
##	Remote and Immediate Access.

Telemedicine improves the communication among providers and between patients and physicians. But it also has the potential to improve models of care by increasing communication among physicians. The possibility for doctors to immediately contact another physician results in a more efficient and higher quality care service.
