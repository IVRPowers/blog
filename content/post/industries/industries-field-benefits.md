## Faster Resolution Times.

RTC technology enables **peer interactions and collaborative experiences.** It allows the field worker to count on immediate assistance from the office workers or experts to help solve technical problems in the work site. Combined with the wide variety of features available, which make it possible to send documents, photos or videos in real time, **resolution times are accelerated.**


## Reduction of Onsite visits.

The possibility that the field worker can have remote support from experts not only speeds up the resolution process, but also avoids a technician having to make a second visit. This **minimizes customer inconvenience.** An efficient and quick job performance increase customer satisfaction.


## Cost-Efficiency.

Reduction of onsite visits and time spent on problem solving has a significant impact on cost efficiency. Not only the cost of a second visit to the customers’ site is eliminated, but also the cost of time spent on solving a single problem is minimized. All together allow to **increase the volume of customers’ requests** and therefore, the incomes.
