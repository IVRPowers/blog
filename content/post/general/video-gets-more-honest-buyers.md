According to a *W. Frank Barton School of Business at Wichita State University* new research, sending a text message, making a phone call or have a face-to-face conversation leads people to lie often than video conferencing. The study found that buyers were:
	
 * 95% more likely to report deception via **text messages** than if they had interacted via video
 * 31% more likely to report deception when compared to **face-to-face** communication in person
 * 18% more likely if the interaction was via **audio chat** or **phone call**.
 
The fact that people were less likely to lie via video than in person was surprising, David Xu said, but makes sense given the so-called “spotlight” effect, where a person feels they’re being watched more closely on video than face-to-face.
