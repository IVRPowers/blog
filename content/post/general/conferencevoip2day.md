Interactive Powers (IVRPowers) founder CEO, Iván Sixto, gave a conference about trends on communication in VoIP2Day meeting. He provided a general overview of current situation on communications. Users’ behaviors and preferences are changing as we are always connected, specially through our phones. It means a huge amount of data is circulating. However, [we don’t use anymore our mobile phones just to call.](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/sep/08/one-in-four-uk-smartphone-weekly-phone-calls)

IVRPowers founder talked about how different ways to communicate are already present in our everyday lives. Technology trends show that video is the next step to transform our communications. According to Facebook 50% of data is video, and figures are growing. In 2021, it will go up to 70%. Video is the richest format to obtain information, the easiest and the fastest. And increasingly important is video RTC. 

Real-Time Communications (RTC), such as live video chats, raise the value of relationships with customers. WebRTC technology is a great option to companies that wish to differentiate themselves enhancing their customer services. Iván Sixto explained how RTC technology works and highlighted the top five advantages of video. First, video communications allow to establish empathy. The second aspect is that video gives authenticity. The third point is immediacy. Forth power that video has is effectivity. And, finally, the last one is the ability to identify people who are interacting.
