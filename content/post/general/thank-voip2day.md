**Interactive Powers** attended [VoIP2Day 2017,]( http://www.voip2day.com/es/2017) 10th Anniversary Conferences, on November 16th, at Wanda Metropolitano. **Iván Sixto,** founder of Interactive Powers, talked about Cloud API’s novelties for Voice over IP in the presentation entitled [“The Cloud API revolution is coming.”]( http://www.voip2day.com/en/2017/conferencias/la-revolucin-cloud-api-ha-llegado-a-la-voip)

We are delighted with the success of the event and the warm welcome of our participation. **Interest of the public in voice integration APIs exceeded all our expectations.**

We would like to **thank our partners,** [USA-VOIP]( https://www.usa-voip.com/) and [Avanzada7,]( https://www.avanzada7.com/es) and all the people who were involved in organizing the event. It was, once again, a great success, and we hope all participants enjoyed it as much as we did.

See you next year at VoIP2Day 2018!
