#	The Video RTC Gateway is now ready to run with Edge Browser over Windows computers and devices.
---

At [Interactive Powers](https://www.ivrpowers.com/), we are really excited that [Video RTC](https://ivrpowers.com/videortc) platforms and API Framework / Mobile SDK are now supporting Microsoft’s new Chromium based Edge Browser aka Edgium. From now, your real-time applications will work on Microsoft’s latest Edge browser released **without any changes or updates in your existing code / services already deployed!**

The new **Microsoft Edge browser is built on the Chromium open source project** which also powers Google’s Chrome browser. With Microsoft adopting Chromium, developers will benefit from **spending less time on interoperability** because of seamless webrtc integration with other popular browsers including, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari!

##	Video RTC · Edge Browser 79.0.309
