# **Enhancing Customer Engagement with Direct Calls or Video Calls through WhatsApp in your Contact Center**

WhatsApp has become an indispensable communication channel in today's digital landscape, bridging the gap between consumers and businesses of all sizes. This transformation is especially notable in European and Latin American markets—with Brazil leading the way—where WhatsApp is deeply woven into daily communications, achieving remarkable user adoption and engagement. Contact centers have recognized this shift and are integrating WhatsApp into their customer engagement frameworks, meeting customers on their preferred platform while providing natural, accessible support. The shift has been so successful that even small and medium-sized enterprises have moved away from traditional phone lines and SMS in favor of WhatsApp's dynamic platform.

Contact centers can integrate WhatsApp through two main approaches: directly using WhatsApp Business tools or implementing comprehensive omnichannel platforms that incorporate WhatsApp alongside other channels. These platforms efficiently handle routing automation and agent task distribution, optimizing resource allocation. Through these integrations, organizations maintain efficient communication while managing customer interactions to maximize both operational efficiency and satisfaction.

### **The Power of Automation: First-Level Chatbots**

Automation is fundamental to WhatsApp adoption in contact centers. Chatbot engines handle routine inquiries and provide self-service options, ranging from simple menu-based systems to sophisticated AI-driven conversations.

Beyond improving efficiency, automation helps businesses handle high interaction volumes. When needed, chatbots smoothly transfer conversations to human agents, letting customers speak with real people through a familiar platform.

### **The Real-Time Challenge: No Native Support for Calls or Video Calls**

Despite its widespread use, WhatsApp has limitations that frustrate customers. Many want to switch from text to voice or video calls for complex or sensitive matters. However, **Meta's WhatsApp Platform official API doesn't support these features**, limiting contact center interactions to text only.

This constraint creates significant challenges, particularly when trust, confidence, and secure information sharing are crucial for effective communication and business efficiency.

### **A Game-Changing Solution: Video RTC - SPLIT WhatsApp**

To address this limitation, we developed **SPLIT WhatsApp** protocol mode, an innovative solution enabling one-click voice or video connections between customers and agents. Without dialing phone numbers, users can transition smoothly from text to voice or video communication.

#### **How It Works:**

SPLIT WhatsApp uses our Video RTC (Real-Time Communication) channels for instant, direct connections. The system uses the agent's extension to prevent conflicting assignments, ensuring smooth, prioritized interactions for Contact Center agents.

#### **Main Features:**

1. **Instant Access:** Calls connect immediately without delays or routing providing instant support.
2. **Fast Connection:** One-click, tokenized direct connection to your assigned agent.
3. **Enhanced Security:** End-to-end encryption with AES 256-bit protects sensitive information.
4. **Privacy Compliance:** Unlike Meta's platform, SPLIT WhatsApp handles sensitive data securely, making it ideal for industries with strict privacy requirements like Healthcare, Financial Services, Governments…
5. **Video Call Recording:** All video calls can be recorded and managed for quality assurance and business protection.

#### **Compliance:**

Organizations have the flexibility to utilize either WhatsApp Business tools or any Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) integration that suits their needs. To ensure maximum compatibility and efficiency, we provide extensive integration capabilities, including direct integration with popular platforms such as Genesys Cloud. Additionally, we offer native integration support for our Web ACD-based endpoints specifically designed for Video Contact Center operations—this functionality has been available since version 1.2X and leverages the advanced capabilities of our cutting-edge Video RTC 6.X Video Gateways to deliver optimal performance and reliability.

### **Building to Better Customer Experiences**

Contact centers must evolve beyond traditional text-based communication methods to meet the growing demands for exceptional customer experiences in today's digital age. By incorporating advanced communication capabilities, organizations can create more meaningful and effective interactions with their customers. SPLIT WhatsApp stands at the forefront of this evolution, fundamentally transforming customer engagement through its innovative implementation of secure, real-time voice and video interactions.
