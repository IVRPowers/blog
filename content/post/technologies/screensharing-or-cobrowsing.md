# Discover Screen Sharing and Co-Browsing advantages, the secure new ‘no download’  complementary interactions improving phone calls for onboarding, sales and support.

**Screen Sharing** and **Co-Browsing** (or Collaborative Browsing) are a relatively new technologies for Call Centers propelled by a Cloud evolution. However, customer experience professionals seem to think that CoBrowsing and Screen Sharing are one and the same when in reality, they’re not. So what is the difference between these two features and how does adapting your VideoRTC solution improve the overall customer experience?

To answer this question, we need to identify and define the concepts individually:

##	What is Screen Sharing?
Screen Sharing is the ability to share an application’s window or an entire desktop in real-time. Your user will see remotely it in a web browser without any downloads. It’s an important feature to provide a really better customer support.

##	What is Dual Screen Sharing?
Dual Screen Sharing is an simple improvement of Screen Sharing allowing both user and agent to share themselves a screen or all the desktop each other. This update provides a better a customer experience for any business interaction.

##	What is Co-Browsing?
Co-browsing is the natural next step in the evolution of screen sharing an dual Screen sharing. It’s the ability to click once to see your customer’s web browser and take control remotely to guide them, instantly. Without any plugin or downloads.

## In Conclusion...

**Screen Sharing** paved the way to integrated collaborative customer/agent interactions. In order to outshine competition, companies need to provide more agile solutions that can drive agents to walk prospects through their journey. This is where **Co-Browsing** comes in.
