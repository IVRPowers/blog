![VoiceXML W3C](/postimages/posts/technologies/ivrpowers-posts-01.071.jpeg)

The **Voice eXtensible Markup Language (VoiceXML)** is an XML-based markup language for creating distributed voice applications, much as HTML is a markup language for creating distributed visual applications. It is an industry standard defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml21/ (for VoiceXML V2.1) and http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml20/ (for VoiceXML V2.0). The VoiceXML language enables IVR developers to use a familiar markup style and Web server-side logic to deliver applications for use over telephone lines. The resulting VoiceXML applications can interact with existing back-end business data and logic.

Using VoiceXML, application developers can create Web-based voice applications that users can access by telephone or other digital devices.

VoiceXML supports dialogs that feature:

* Recognition of spoken input ("automatic-speech-recognition")
* DTMF input ("phone keypad")
* Recording of spoken input
* Synthesized speech output (“text-to-speech”)
* Pre-recorded digitized audio output
* Dialog flow control
* Scoping of input
* Automatic Number Identification (ANI)
* Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS)
* Call transfer
