An interactive kiosk is **a computer terminal** that is placed in a public setting. The aim of a kiosk is to provide information to customers and users. They have an integrated touch screen, usually with **a user-friendly interface to facilitate interactions.** Thanks to computing technology it is possible to offer a wide range of functions and applications, from brand information, to product catalogues or real-time interactions with sales consultants.


## What industries can take advantage of interactive kiosks?

Interactive kiosks are used as **powerful marketing tools and advanced customer services.** Because they can be customized, applications are endless. 

An interactive kiosk allows to borrow a book from a library, but it can also perform a bank transaction. Mobile stores or car providers, where there are usually long queues that deter customers from entering in the store, can **improve efficiency and reinforce brand loyalty** thanks to interactive kiosks. We also find kiosks at airports to **accelerate** check-in processes or at retailers, such as clothing stores, drugstores and cosmetic shops to **provide customers advice and information about products.**
