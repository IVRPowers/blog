In essence, any software in the Internet is an inherent risk that your PC may become infected by a virus, malware, spyware or various other ‘bugs’ that threaten the security of your data. As such, the principal solution to combat viruses is to install firewalls and anti-malware software that work **to defend your computer against any potential threats.**

With [WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/) however, there’s no need to worry about any of that. Because WebRTC works from browser to browser, you don’t need to download any software or plugins in order to set up a video conference or VOIP call. All the security that you need is already **contained within your browser** and the [WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/) platform.

Some of the **in-built security features** contained within a [WebRTC System](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/marketing/webrtc-system-benefits/) include:
	
- Camera and Microphone Security
- Peer-to-Peer Encryption
- Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
- Secure Real-Time Protocol (SRTP)


#### Camera and Microphone Security

Unlike some other video and audio software, WebRTC **requires the user to enable access** to their microphone and camera before communications begin. Typically, your web browser will ask you to allow a webcam and microphone permission before getting connected.


#### Peer-to-Peer Encryption

Encryption is built in to WebRTC as a permanent feature and addresses all security concerns effectively. Regardless of what server or compatible browser you’re using, private peer-to-peer communication is safe thanks to WebRTC’s advanced **end-to-end encryption features.**


#### Data Transport Layer Security (DTLS)

Any data that is transferred through a [WebRTC system](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/marketing/webrtc-system-benefits/) is encrypted using the Datagram Transport Layer Security method. This encryption is already built-in to compatible web browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Opera) thus **eavesdropping or data manipulation can’t happen.**


#### Secure Real-Time Protocol (SRTP)

In addition to offering DTLS encryption, WebRTC also encrypts data through Secure Real-Time Protocol, which **safeguards IP communications** from hackers, so your video and audio data is kept private.
