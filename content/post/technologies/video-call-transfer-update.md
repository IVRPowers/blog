# Revolutionizing Video Call Transfers: Improved Customer Experience
---

We are thrilled to announce an exciting new feature on our [Web ACD](https://interactivepowers.com/en/platforms/webacd) platforms that significantly enhances Video Call Transfers. This innovative addition is designed to streamline operations and improve the overall user experience for both agents and customers.

Previously, our system relied on direct extension or service transfers, which, while functional, had limitations in providing comprehensive information during the transfer process. Now, we have implemented a sophisticated and user-friendly solution that takes our video call transfer capabilities to the next level.

Our new feature introduces **a complete selector interface that displays the status of all agents in real-time**. This comprehensive overview allows the transferring agent to make more informed decisions when redirecting calls. By providing detailed information about each agent's current status, we enable a smoother, more efficient transfer process that optimizes resource allocation and minimizes wait times for customers.

This enhancement not only improves the flow of information between agents during operations but also contributes to a more seamless and professional customer experience. We believe this update will significantly boost productivity and satisfaction for both our agents and the clients they serve.
