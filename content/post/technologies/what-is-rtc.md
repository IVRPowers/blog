A clear definition of **Real-time communications (RTC)** is important to understand what will be the newest evolution of Internet applications and services for businesses and individuals. All is moving around to more real-time, more video, better sound quality, better screen resolution, easier human-interfaces… RTC technology helps to share together most of our senses thru digital networks at light’s speed:

RTC is any mode of telecommunications in which all users can exchange information instantly or with negligible latency. In this context, the term “real-time” is synonymous with “live.” RTC can take place in half-duplex or full-duplex modes. In half-duplex RTC, data can be transmitted in both directions on a single carrier or circuit but not at the same time. In full-duplex RTC, data can be transmitted in both directions simultaneously on a single carrier or circuit. RTC generally refers to peer-to-peer communications, not broadcast or multicast.

RTC can include:

* Telephony in the conventional sense
* Mobile and cellular telephone
* Two-way or multi-way amateur radio
* IM (instant messaging)
* VoIP (Voice over IP, also called Internet telephone)
* IRC (Internet Relay Chat) or other chatting modes
* Live videoconference communications
* Live teleconference communications
* Robotic telepresence
