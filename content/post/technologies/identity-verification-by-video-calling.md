# A Robust, Effective, and Reliable Solution both for Businesses and Users.
-------

In today's constantly evolving business environment and digital transformation, identity verification has become a critical process, driven by three factors that are redefining online security. First, the evolution of regulatory compliance establishes increasingly demanding standards for user authentication. Second, vulnerabilities and breaches in personal data protection are multiplying, creating new challenges in safeguarding and using sensitive information. Third, we face an unprecedented increase in online fraud sophistication, especially identity theft, affecting onboarding processes, service contracting, reservations, or even government procedures.

> Identity theft and personal data breaches constitute one of the greatest risks for digital development.

### ◾️New Digital Security Challenges Affecting Businesses

The landscape becomes even more complex with the emergence of widely accessible Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools. These technologies now allow the creation of fake documents, photos, and videos with unprecedented realism and dynamism, compromising the reliability of methods such as document scanning or facial biometric authentication. This new uncertainty about digital authenticity or the devices used by users adds additional security risk.

> Generative AI is one of the most challenging technologies for cybersecurity of all time.

### ◾️Video Call: Superior method against Generative AI

Although online verification has advanced significantly through scanning and facial biometrics, it's necessary to incorporate more robust and agile methods, especially for real-time transactions that demand speed without compromising security. Video call verification emerges as the most effective solution, offering an optimal balance between security and user experience. Its main advantage lies in the fact that it cannot be falsified with current technologies due to computation levels that will be required in the future.

> Video calls are a unique method that enables best-in-class and convenient fraud detection.

### ◾️Unique Advantages of Video Call Verification

The superiority of this method is based on several technical factors. Current GenAI cannot simulate real-time human interaction during a video call. The demands for processing and instant response exceed currently available technological capabilities. Additionally, the protocol includes dynamic elements such as live camera capture, random questions, and requests for specific movements or objects, creating a complexity that current GenAI cannot naturally replicate.

> Video calls are a game changer that revolutionizes digital security verification.

### ◾️ Automation Against GenAI is Not Effective

Although many companies consider that any verification solution must be based exclusively on complete automation, it's important to highlight that investing in these methods based on technical complexity is not effective against the advancement of GenAI, as it has a very rapid and almost limitless evolution capacity in the cyber environment. However, a simple direct human interaction sits in a terrain where GenAI finds itself at a clear disadvantage.

> Video calls serve as the strongest barrier against online fraud, both stopping and deterring it.

In conclusion, **Video Call Verification** currently represents the most robust and reliable option for identity authentication in the digital business environment, especially for governments, banks and insurers, online booking centers, etc., significantly complementing conventional methods of identity data capture in terms of guaranteeing greater effectiveness, speed, and transactional reliability. It's also important to highlight its use as a cyber deterrence tool, as companies with this capability are not only more effective at avoiding risk but also eliminate the temptation of fraud.
