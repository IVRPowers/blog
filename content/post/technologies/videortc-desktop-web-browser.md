##	Apple Safari

Apple Safari...

##	Google Chrome

Google Chrome is the first one on our list as the pioneering WebRTC-enabled browser since Google Chrome version 17 in 2012. Prior to that, no browser could offer video calls without special client applications. Therefore, users have cheered the mere idea of audio and video capture capabilities and its playback directly in browser.

##	Mozilla Firefox

Mozilla Firefox supports WebRTC beginning with its 18th Aurora build that initially required manual setting for video calls functionality. WebRTC wasnâ€™t enabled by default, since 2012 Firefox released the 22nd version that enabled WebRTC by default.

##	Opera Browser

Opera, as well as in the abovementioned browser, the support for WebRTC standard was implemented in the 18th version released in December 2013. It is in this build that the support for getUserMedia API interface was enabled by default; the interface is an integrated part of WebRTC technology.
