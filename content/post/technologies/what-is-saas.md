# Software as a Service (SaaS)
---

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** directly refers to any software that your business is using just about everyday. SaaS is of course a form of cloud computing, which allows for increase flexibility by relying on a third-party vendor to host and maintain the service â€” in this case, that **service is that software**. Since the software is hosted by a cloud provider, your business does not need to install and run applications on their own computers, or host their own servers in expensive data centers, yet still gains access to these powerful tools.

> SaaS is easier, faster, and less expensive compare to on-premise.

This of course also brings flexibility as we have mentioned above, but more specifically within the payments, as SaaS generally utilizes a **pay-as-you-go pricing modality**. SaaS also allows for  easy, automatic updates to be pushed out by the provider, greater accessibility to the software, and expansion with Cloud API powered integrations.
