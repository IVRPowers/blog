In today's digital world, customers expect to have a variety of communication options when interacting with businesses. Video is becoming an increasingly popular choice, and companies are finding that adding a video channel to their contact center is not just "a nice to have" but a necessity. That's why a **Video Contact Center** or VCC is the solution you've been looking for.

By [adding Video Channels to your Contact Center](https://interactivepowers.com/en/platforms/videortc#third-party-call-center-integrations), you can provide face-to-face interaction for your agents and improve your business with a more human customer care experience. This allows your agents to build rapport and trust with your customers in a way that's simply not possible through traditional phone or chat channels. Video interactions can help you create a more personal and engaging customer experience, which can lead to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and even revenue.

A **Video Contact Center also provides amazing Web Collaboration** capabilities that can help your agents and customers work together in real-time. For example, your agents can use screen sharing and co-browsing to provide visual assistance and guidance to your customers. This can help resolve issues faster and more effectively, which can improve the overall customer experience and reduce customer frustration.

Another benefit of a **Video Contact Center is its ability to help you scale your business**. With video channels, your agents can handle more complex issues and provide more comprehensive support to your customers. This can reduce the need for additional support resources and help you improve efficiency and reduce costs.

A **Video Contact Center can be customized to meet your specific business needs**. We can help you integrate video channels into your existing contact center infrastructure, or we can help you create a completely new solution from scratch.
