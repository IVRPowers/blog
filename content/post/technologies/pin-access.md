If you wish to utilize **Video RTC / Solutions** as part of your support efforts, a custom PIN access, where your customers can enter a unique pin code to connect with an agent is another way to start co-browsing, screen sharing or voice & video calling. You only have to redirects your customers to a landing page like our new one: https://pwrs.in/go.
