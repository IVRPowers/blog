# Revolutionizing Customer Experience in Video Communications
---

In today's communication landscape, interruptions and wireless network disconnections are inevitable. These issues can significantly affect the quality of internet and video calls, presenting a serious challenge. They often lead to substantial time waste for both agents and users, frequently resulting in incomplete transactions. This problem is particularly critical in contact centers, where most service providers lack effective recovery mechanisms for phone calls. Consequently, workflows often need to restart from the beginning, causing frustration and inefficiency.

### 2- Accelerating the Reconnection Process

The **Video Call Recovery** feature has been designed with user-friendliness and simplicity in mind, requiring no additional effort from either users or agents. The process is remarkably straightforward: users can simply reload and initiate a recall, whereupon their session is automatically recognized as in progress. This intelligent system then routes the call to the first available agent without any delays typically associated with queuing. Simultaneously, the agent enters a specialized Recovery mode, which prevents them from receiving new video calls or interactions, ensuring their availability for the reconnection.
