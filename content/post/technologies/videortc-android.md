#	Make direct voice and video calls from Android devices thanks to VideoRTC.js and its native WebRTC based tecnology
---

In [previous posts](http://blog.ivrpowers.com//tags/code/), we have looked at some key considerations for building apps for video calling on web browsers and mobile devices, and some of the features you can include to make sure your users have a great experience. 

Now any modern Android works with all compliant Smartphone, TV and Tablet devices which is an important component for creating frictionless, delightful apps, especially voice & video calling. It’s an important news for all companies that could now receive calls from Android’s users without any PSTN number and without any plugin or app! 

Just create a web calling service with our [VideoRTC.js](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/development/introducing-videortcjs-developers/) functions!
