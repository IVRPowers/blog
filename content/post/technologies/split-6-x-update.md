The sixth generation Video RTC Gateways, meticulously developed by Interactive Powers, incorporate the innovative SPLIT module. This advanced feature enables the seamless separation of all media streams, including video, audio, and data, providing unprecedented flexibility and control. The **SPLIT module** represents a significant leap forward in communication technology, allowing for more efficient handling and routing of multimedia content.

This cutting-edge development is currently based on a robust combination of SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technologies. These protocols work in tandem to facilitate the seamless integration of voice, video, and data communications within Contact Centers (CC). By leveraging these industry-standard protocols, Interactive Powers ensures broad compatibility and interoperability, making it easier for Contact Centers to smoothly adopt transactional video calling.

Available SPLIT Modes:

## SPLIT Forward

Automatically route Inbound Video Calls to available CC Agents.

## SPLIT Reverse

Make Outbound Video Calls from a CC Agent to an Internet User.

## SPLIT Scheduled

Schedule Video Calls to any CC Agent for a negotiated task.

Connect an IA Assistant to CC Agents during Calls or Video Calls.

## SPLIT Deaf Interpreter *New

Connect a Deaf Sign Language Interpreter to Outbound Phone Calls.

## SPLIT WhatsApp *New

It's important to note that the SPLIT module and its associated protocols have been engineered with versatility in mind. They are fully compatible with Web ACD, our proprietary video-centric Contact Center agent platform, which has been specifically designed to leverage the full potential of these advanced features. However, the flexibility of our solution extends beyond our own ecosystem. The SPLIT module seamlessly integrates with any CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service) solution available in the market, ensuring that businesses can incorporate our cutting-edge video communication capabilities into their existing infrastructure without disruption.

Therefore, we encourage you to reach out to our team of experts with any specific questions or concerns you may have regarding your business needs.
