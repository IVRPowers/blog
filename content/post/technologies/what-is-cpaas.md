# Communication Platform as a Service (CPaaS)
---

**Communication Platform as a Service (CPaaS)** is a form of cloud computing that is utilized to deliver communication applications like IVR or RTC to users over the internet. But, unlike [SaaS](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-saas/) which delivers specific apps and programs, **Communication Platform as a Service is a bit closer related to IaaS**. So, while IaaS is delivering the infrastructure, like servers and management tools, CPaaS is what delivers the entire communication platform for users to build and develop their own applications.

> CPaaS is a useful technology for businesses of all sizes.

CPaaS use to be charged on a **pay-per-use basis**, and generally allows for intense management of the services and applications that are being built over it. The main benefit is that developers don’t have to construct their own physical servers or infrastructure, they can simply rent “virtual” servers on which to host their communications applications. Everything is also accessed through a web browser or phone allowing for simple use, flexibility and mobility.
