Facial recognition is a biometric method of identifying an individual by comparing live capture or digital image data with the stored record for that person. Facial recognition systems are commonly used for security purposes but they are increasingly applied in a wide variety of fields, like in mobile technology, online to shopping, even in medicine.

In a previous post we talked about [secure identification API integrations](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/products/video-rtc-video-id/) and some of their uses.

## API Framework.

We showed you two plugins about facial recognition. These two technologies, [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/) and [Face++](https://www.faceplusplus.com/), are two powerful tools which allow to use and integrate facial recognition in any application, with optimal results.

## Our Use Cases.

We have incorporated two facial recognition technologies **into one of our video products.** The access is guaranteed only to the person who recognises the biometric identification system. In our case we are using facial recognition of two different technologies, so it is the user who decides what plugins will activate.

**The procedure is simple:** a photo of the user will be registered in the stored record of biometric systems, with the data associated with that person.

After the user has uploaded a photo to the recognition system, he must log with videoID.

If the system recognizes the correct user, it will let him enter the video room.

Otherwise, the system will not allow the access.
