Security tops the list on concerns about [IoT](http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/security-in-the-internet-of-things). Considering the risks of new exposed system vulnerabilities and the increasing scope and scale of breaches, **security is more important than ever.** In fact, uncertainty about which device provides privacy and security has become a hindrance to [purchasing an IoT device.](https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Whats-Stopping-Consumers-Buying-Internet-of-Things-Devices/1013501) But despite the increasing concerns among consumers, researches show that security is still one of the major challenges that companies need to deal with.
 
The foundation of security is exerting control over the environment you are protecting. The problem is that there is not a single coherent strategic model to follow. On the other hand, security measures alone cannot provide an appropriated protection. It must be a continuously framework of control, technical, but also organizational and educational.
 
### Protect your assets

Every business has a different set of factors they need to consider to protect. For that reason, they have to **identify priorities** and address towards them all security efforts. Protecting critical and sensitive information must be one of the biggest priorities for businesses. For instance, health care data, customer information or strategic agreements are high-value assets.
 
The most popular free video conferencing tools do not provide protection of communications from, for instance, third partsâ€™ surveillance. If you work with sensitive information, it is time for you to **reevaluate your digital communications channels and consider more secure solutions.**

### Some steps to increase security
 
At Interactive Powers we are aware of security concerns and **our solutions include critical features to guarantee private communications.** As [WebRTC](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/technologies/what-is-webrtc/) is embedded in browsers, you avoid malware that may come package with plugin downloads. Data flows are encrypted, authenticated by the SRTP (Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol) and the end user must grant an explicit permission to access their cameras and microphones.
 
Do not forget that **a security environment adds a significant value** to your business as well. Growing concerns of customers about privacy makes addressing security needs a differentiator.
