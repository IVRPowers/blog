### **What makes SPLIT WhatsApp unique?**

SPLIT WhatsApp is not just an extension of the world's most popular messaging channel; it's a hybrid solution that integrates the best of **WebRTC** and **SIP** technology.

This capability allows companies to add real transactional communications, as well as voice and video support to WhatsApp Business, unifying existing channels and improving the user experience.
