#   Video RTC Gateways are now ready to run most modern Web Browsers and Operating Systems for your Business.
---

We can observe **the success of WebRTC** Technology through the evolution of web browsers. Increasingly more and more browsers are WebRTC-enabled, having incorporated the possibility of making video calls. In most of them users do not need even to install special applications or plugins. Let’s see what four of the most important web browsers on the market currently offer.
 
###  Apple Safari.

Both MacOS and iOS released a version of Safari with support for WebRTC. It allows interoperability with other web browsers and the data channel works. However, Safari users will have to wait for the screen sharing to be available, as in the latest version, this capability still not yet ready but is not required for all services.

###  Google Chrome.

Google Chrome is the first one and leader on our list as the pioneering WebRTC-enabled browser since Google Chrome version 17 in 2012. Prior to that, no browser could offer video calls without special client applications. Therefore, users have cheered the mere idea of audio and video capture capabilities and its playback directly in browser.

### Microsoft Edge. *New

Microsoft Edge 79 (01-15-2020) is now built on the Chromium open source project which also powers Google’s Chrome browser. With Microsoft adopting Chromium, developers will benefit from spending less time on interoperability because of seamless webrtc integration with other popular browsers including, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari!

###  Mozilla Firefox.

Mozilla Firefox supports WebRTC since 18th Aurora version. However, WebRTC was not enable by default and it initially required manual settings for video calls functionality. Good news is that it is no longer necessary since 2012, when Firefox released the 22nd version that enabled WebRTC by default.

###  Opera Browser.

Opera, as well as Mozilla Firefox, implemented WebRTC standard in the 18th version, released in December 2013. In this build, support for obtaining UserMedia API interface was enabled by default as the interface is an integrated part of WebRTC technology.

##  What type of devices are supported.

In 2020, all updated desktop computer and mobile devices can install a default Web Browser enabled to process WebRTC and without any plugin requirement!
