#	Make direct voice calls from Apple iOS devices thanks to VideoRTC.js and its native WebRTC based tecnology
---

In [previous posts](http://blog.ivrpowers.com//tags/code/), we have looked at some key considerations for **building apps for video calling on web browsers and mobile devices**, and some of the features you can include to make sure your users have a great experience. 

Now  **iOS 11 works with all compliant Apple iPhone and iPad devices** which is an important component for creating frictionless, delightful apps, especially voice calling. Itâ€™s an important news for all companies that could now receive calls without PSTN and without any plugin or app! 

Just create a web calling service with our [VideoRTC.js](http://blog.ivrpowers.com/post/development/introducing-videortcjs-developers/) functions!
