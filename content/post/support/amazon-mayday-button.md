Five years ago, Amazon launched the Mayday button to its line of Kindle Fire tablets. It provides on-device tech support all day, every day. Just by tapping the Mayday button the Kindle user is put in direct contact with an Amazon technician. 

In less than six months, the feature became the most popular way for Kindle customers to contact Amazon’s customer service. What are the ingredients for success?

First of all, it gives customers the option of reaching out to a real person. The user receives live audio and video of the technician. Advisor receives audio from customers and can only see user’s screen. If the user grants access, tech support can get on the device to solve issues. Technician can also draw on the screen, walking the user through different actions. In the video, you can watch an example:

The second most important value added by the Mayday button is that it makes customers feel they are the center of the company. Thanks to live assistance, it is easier for Amazon’s tech support to fix problems. The system is also better to customers, it’s efficient and more comfortable. Another key that explains its success is that the average Amazon response time to calls for help is 15 seconds.

The positive results of Amazon’s service open the door to innovative opportunities in different businesses. Just think how important this support system could be to health providers, e-commerce, financial services or call centers.
