      <description>Photo source: Interactive Powers Direct Human Communication Has a Premium Effect in the AI Era If the cost per minute of an employee is practically identical regardless of channel (text, voice, or video), why do we continue using them predominantly in the channel with the lowest emotional bandwidth?
Competing with AI in text or voice speed is a battle lost from the start. Humans have no rival in empathy, intuition, and nonverbal communication.</description>

      <description>Photo source: Interactive Powers The Machine as Efficient Filter, the Human as High-Value Connection Next-generation voicebots have achieved quality almost indistinguishable from human voice in guided dialogues, significantly reducing operational costs compared to the average agent in Europe and Latin America. The financial equation drives massive automation of the traditional phone channel.
However, when interaction requires handling complex emotional ambiguity, delicate negotiation, or trust recovery, AI reaches its limit. Attempting to &amp;ldquo;deceive&amp;rdquo; the customer by passing the bot off as human generates frustration and loss of credibility as soon as limitations are detected.</description>

      <description>Photo source: Interactive Powers Rethinking Text Chat Support in Contact Centers Over the past decade, the customer service industry prioritized concurrency in text channels—live chat, WhatsApp, and tickets—under the belief that an agent could efficiently handle 3 or 4 conversations simultaneously. Today, with the maturity of Generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs), that premise has become obsolete.
The data from 2024-2025 is conclusive: maintaining human agents on routine text tasks represents an inefficient use of talent.</description>

      <description>Photo source: Interactive Powers Why adopting digital communications improves professional interactions. Professional communication is experiencing a profound transformation. Traditional calls through the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) are being replaced by digital solutions such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Zoom, Google Meet, or VoIP technologies. This transition is not just technological: it responds to a natural evolution of the market, driven by new user expectations, operational efficiency, and privacy criteria.
Below are 6 strategic reasons why companies should consider adopting digital calls and video calls as a fundamental part of their communication model:</description>

      <description>Photo source: Interactive Powers The strategic integration of AI with human attention revolutionizes today&amp;rsquo;s Contact Centers, ensuring expert care right when the customer needs it. In contact centers, automated processes have grown in recent years driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) —chatbots, social media auto-responses, or conversational IVR systems— streamline customer service, although they cannot solve all user needs. Seamless Escalation allows transitioning from these processes to human attention or Human Intelligence (HI) naturally, staying in a digital channel through real-time communication via voice, video, and text.</description>

      <description>Photo source: Interactive Powers Consumers rank first-contact resolution as the most valued aspect of a service interaction, yet CX leaders rank it ninth In the competitive world of customer service, a key metric or Key Performance Indicator (KPI) stands out: First-Contact Resolution (FCR). Customers not only expect quick solutions—ideally, speaking with an agent within 1 to 10 minutes—but they also expect to resolve their query in that first interaction. According to a Genesys Study, although consumers trust that artificial intelligence and innovative tools will improve their experience, when facing personal situations or complex complaints, they prefer direct attention from a human agent capable of listening, understanding, and resolving situations beyond simple automated responses.</description>

They primarily rely on text-based communication, lacking real-time, voice-to-voice interaction. These constraints often result in misunderstandings, slower problem resolution, and a less personal customer experience (CX). Without immediate vocal communication, the natural flow of conversation is impeded, making it challenging to convey tone, urgency, or complex information effectively.</description>
